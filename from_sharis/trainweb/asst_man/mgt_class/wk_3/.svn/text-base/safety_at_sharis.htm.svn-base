          <p class="style1">In order to impress upon the new employee the importance of their Safety Orientation you must be organized, prepared and know the information you will be covering. Gather all needed items <u><strong>before</strong></u> the new employee arrives for orientation and prepare the area you will use. </p>
          <p class="style1">If you haven't already, print of the <a href="safety_orientation_checklist.htm" target="_blank">Safety Orientation Checklist</a> and get the Orientation Binder and Safety Orientation video from the office. Find the Safety Orientation Manager's Outline tab in the Employee Orientation Binder - this is a script that you will use during the orientation. This script follows the video and the safety orientation checklist and is designed to use in conjunction with the video and the checklist. Using these three aids together helps us conduct a very thorough orientation that is consistent from employee to employee. It also ensures that we meet the legal training requirements outlined by OSHA and WISHA: the federal and state safety and health association. </p>
          <p class="style1">For example:</p>
          <p class="style1"><u>#1 from the Manager's Outline</u> tells you what to say to the new employee to introduce the Safety Orientation: &quot;Every new employee will receive a Safety Orientation. We will cover employee responsibilities, use of chemicals and first aid procedures for each, MSDS binder, equipment safety, disease prevention, lifting procedures, protective equipment, reporting of accidents and unsafe conditions, Safety Committee, and complete a safety tour of the restaurant.&quot; It then instructs you to show the Safety Orientation Video.</p>
          <p class="style1"><u>#1 from the Employee Safety Orientation Checklist</u> is: Employee Safety Orientation video Presentation and Review Safety Orientation Introduction.</p>
          <p class="style1">At the beginning of the orientation, instruct the new employee to initial each section of the Safety Orientation Checklist as it is covered. Their initials will prove that each section was covered with them, whereas a check mark could have been made by anyone. When an OSHA or WISHA inspector come in, one of the thing he will ask for is proof of safety training - the checklist complete with the employee's initials and signature will satisfy this request. </p>
          <p class="style1">While viewing the Safety Video you will need to stay with the employee and watch the video with them. During the video it will instruct you to &quot;stop the video now&quot; and explain or demonstrate items such as; emergency reference binder, proper hand washing, proper lifting and explaining the MSDS binder.</p>
          <p class="style1">During the safety orientation both you and the new employee will have forms to sign. Remember, these are legal documents that provide proof of training - they are important. All of these form are located in the Company and Safety Orientation booklet that the employee receives. Review the following list of items requiring signatures.<br>
