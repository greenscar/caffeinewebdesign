    <td colspan="2"><p>Shari's has developed a program to manage training in the stores. It is called Shari's CEO Program. The acronym CEO stands for &quot;Creating Excellence Officer&quot;. This program is a partnership between the store managers and a select group of employees that they choose to train their new employees. This partnership relies on both the management team and the trainers fulfilling their responsibilities and commitment to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> ensure that new employee receives excellent training.</li>
        <li>support the training effort with time, talent and the tools needed to accomplish the task.</li>
        <li>communicate openly to improve themselves and their program.</li>
        <li>invest in their development and continue to grow in knowledge and skill.</li>
        <li>Work together and support one another. </li>
      </ul>      
    <p>To learn about Shari's CEO program, gather your store's &quot;Managers' Training Manual&quot; and turn to the &quot;CEO Training Program&quot; tab. You are to read pages 1-20 (don't worry, it's not that bad). Log into the <a href="http://university.sharis.com/chat">Chat Room</a> by 3:45 for a discussion about your store's CEO program. </p>
