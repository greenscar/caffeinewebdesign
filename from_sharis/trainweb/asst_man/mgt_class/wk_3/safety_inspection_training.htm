<p class="style3"><strong>Material: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Safety Committee Weekly Inspection Checklist (1 per person) </p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clipboards (1 per person) </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Purpose: &nbsp; </strong>To teach the new safety committee how and why to conduct a thorough weekly inspection. Use this as part of the first meeting after new members are elected or have a one-on-one training for any new members of the safety committee. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Who is to be trained: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The New Safety Committee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Each year Shari's spends thousand of dollars on accidents that could have been prevented with a little care. &nbsp; It is the job of the safety committee to maintain a safe environment and the Weekly Inspections Checklist is a tool designed to point out potential danger areas. &nbsp; Today we will conduct an inspection together, pointing out just what we should be looking for. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Discussion </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Prior to beginning the tour, make sure that everyone has his or her own copy of a weekly inspection checklist. &nbsp; They should take notes on specific items to look for, while one person makes the notes for the official inspection for that week. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">Start on the <strong>cook's line </strong> and move to the <strong>prep area </strong> paying close attention to the following items: </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Floors </strong>: </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is there dirt, debris or grease on the floor which could cause a person to slip and fall? &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are any tiles loose or cracked so a person could trip over them? </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Drains </strong>: &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the drains free of debris and odor which could cause a backup of water? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; &nbsp; Are there covers over the drain so no one gets their foot caught in it? </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Equipment: </strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Ask the cooks if all the equipment is working properly. &nbsp; Pay particular attention to the toasters and waffle irons. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the steamers being cleaned shiftly? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the handles and gaskets on the reach-ins in good repair so that no one has to strain to open them? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Check the cords of all equipment to make sure they are not frayed. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is there a minor sticker on the slicer? &nbsp; Is anyone under 18 operating the slicer? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the cooks using and cleaning the slicer correctly? &nbsp; The slicer should be unplugged and cleaned in place, it is too dangerous to carry it to the dish machine and rinse it off. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is a slicer guard available and are the cooks using it properly? </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Prepping: &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are there at least two mesh gloves available? Are the employees using them? Do the gloves have all their fingers and have they been cleaned and sanitized? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Have the knives been sharpened within the last week? &nbsp; People are less likely to cut themselves with a sharp knife. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; There should be only one food item in the prep area at a time. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is the cutting board being cleaned and sanitized between food items? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is there a bucket of sanitation solution on each cook's line and in the prep area? &nbsp; When was the last time the water was changed? </p>
<p class="style3">Now move into the <strong>Walk-in </strong>, <strong>Dry Storage </strong> and the <strong>Freezer </strong></p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Floors: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is there dirt, debris or grease on the floor which could cause a person to slip and fall? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are any tiles loose or cracked so a person could trip over them? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is there a build up of ice on the floor in the freezer? &nbsp; This could cause a person to slip and fall, it also breaks up the tiles over time and causes them to crack and the freezer to be less effective. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Check for visible signs of pests in dry storage, tracks in the dust, black droppings behind the pallets, or gnaw markings on the boxes. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Doors: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The doors in the walk-in and freezer should have an emergency release handle that glows in the dark and easily unlocks the door. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Storage: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Precooked items or items that won't be cooked should be stored above or away from raw items. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Heavier items should be stored on the bottom shelves so no one strains their back getting them down. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; All items should be stored 6 inches off the floor and away from the wall. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Chemicals should not be stored in any of these areas. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; CO2 canisters should be chained to the wall. &nbsp; If a helium tank is present, it too should be chained to the wall. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; All containers should be clearly marked as to what is inside so no one grabs the wrong thing. &nbsp; Date dots should be present and initialed. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Break Area: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The safety board should be clearly marked and have the required posters. &nbsp; A list of the required posters is on the back of the Weekly Inspection Checklist. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The table and booths in the break area should be clean and securely attached to the wall. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; No more than one additional chair should be in the area. &nbsp; More chairs will clog the area and cause a hazard if employees need to evacuate the area in a hurry. &nbsp; Also, someone coming out of dry storage could trip and fall over the chair. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The first-aid kit should contain 2 Hep-Aid kits, a CPR shield, latex gloves and all the items listed on the first-aid kit inventory sheet in the Safety Committee binder. &nbsp; Complete one of those sheets at this time. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Bio-safe should be available for employees to use twice daily. &nbsp; Are the employees using it? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the employees using the hand-washing log? </p>
<p class="style3">Now move to the <strong>dish area </strong>, <strong>baker's station </strong> and <strong>backdoor area </strong></p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Floors: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is there dirt, debris or grease on the floor which could cause a person to slip and fall? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are any tiles loose or cracked so a person could trip over them? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; If your store uses mats, are they clean? &nbsp; They should be free of any tears, nothing should be sticking up on them so someone could trip and fall over them. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; If water is present on the floor is it marked with a wet floor sign? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is a broken glass bucket available and clearly marked? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is there ice or water on the floor in front of the ice machine? </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Equipment: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Have the filters for the dish machine been cleaned lately? &nbsp; This could cause the dish machine to backup and overflow with water. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the arms to the doors and washer arm in good repair? &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The sprayer hose should be free of leaks and the nozzle should be tightly attached. &nbsp; If this were to break it could cause water to spray all over the kitchen. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Does the DMO turn off the water running to the Expert between washes? &nbsp; This could cause the water to over flow as well as use extra chemicals. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Rubber gloves and goggles should be available for the DMO's to change the chemicals. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is a minor sticker present on the mixer? &nbsp; Are minors using the mixer? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is the mixer and cord in good repair? &nbsp; Does the mixer attachment have all of its prongs and are they tightly attached? &nbsp; These could fly off and hurt anyone standing near the mixer. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Has the oven been cleaned within the last week? &nbsp; This could cause the equipment to breakdown quicker or take longer to bake food. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are two oven mitts available? &nbsp; Are they in good repair? </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Storage: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The dishes should be stacked on the DMO shelves so that they don't fall off and hurt anyone. &nbsp; Make sure the shelves are not wobbly. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The ice scoop should be stored on the outside of the ice machine. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Mop buckets should be empty and stored in the mop closet. &nbsp; Mops should be hanging upside down on a hook so they can dry. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; There should be several wet floor signs stored in the mop closet. &nbsp; They should be in good repair, the letters bright and visible. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are chemicals properly labeled? &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is the Safe-Stride sprayer clearly labeled? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The hall leading to the backdoor should be free of debris. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Heavy items should not be stored on the top of the ice machine. &nbsp; This could strain someone's back getting it down. </p>
<p class="style3">Now move out into the <strong>dinning area </strong></p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Floor: &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is the tile area clean and free of water, debris, or grease. &nbsp; This could cause guests as well as employees to slip and fall. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are any tiles loose or cracked, so a person could trip over them? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is the carpet clean and free of debris? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the edges of the carpet securely attached to the floor? &nbsp; Guests could trip over the edges and fall. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Equipment: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Ask the servers if all the equipment is working properly. &nbsp; Pay particular attention to the milkshake machine, syrup urns, and coffee machines. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the handles and gaskets on the reach-ins in good repair so that no one has to strain to open them? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The vacuum should be in good repair. &nbsp; The garbage can that contains the vacuum should be clean inside and out. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Emergency Exit Doors: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Aisle ways to the doors should easily assessable. &nbsp; Chairs and High Chairs should not be stored in front of these doorways. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; The Exit signs should light up even in the day. &nbsp; If they do not, a bulb may need to be changed. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Emergency Equipment: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Have the fire extinguishers been charged within the last year? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are there 911 stickers present on the phone at the hostess stand? </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Storage: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; All closets out front should be clean and well organized. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Items should be clearly labeled and chemicals should not be stored anywhere food is present. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Highchairs should be clean and neatly stacked. &nbsp; Inspect the highchairs for broken straps. &nbsp; If new straps are needed order them from SYSCO. &nbsp; Broken straps could allow a child to fall out of a highchair. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; At least 4 wet floor signs should be present. They should be in good repair and letters bright and visible. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the bleach bottles clearly marked? </p>
<p class="style3">&nbsp; Now go <strong>outside </strong></p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Dumpster area: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the containers closed? &nbsp; This will cut down on pests and odors. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Is the ground clean and free of debris and grease? &nbsp; This too will attract pest and could cause an employee or vendor to fall. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Parking Area: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the sidewalks in good repair? &nbsp; Guests could trip and fall if there are cracks and uneven areas. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Are the curbs in good repair? &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">Now return to the table where you started the meeting. &nbsp; The committee members should be able to answer the following questions based on the employees they work with. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Employees: </strong></p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Do all the employees have the proper footwear? &nbsp; If they do not have rubber soled shoes, they can slip and fall anytime they are walking on the tile, even if it isn't wet. </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Do all the employees consistent say “behind you” when passing other employees? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Has any employee expressed a safety concern to any member of the committee? </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Do the DMO's consistently wear back braces? &nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">&#149;&nbsp; Have you ever observed an employee doing something unsafe to themselves or others? </p>
<p class="style3">This tour should take approximately 20 minutes and should be conducted on a weekly basis. &nbsp; Anytime an inspector finds anything that is unsafe this should be noted on the Weekly Inspection Checklist. </p>
<h1 class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Following-Up </h1>
<p class="style3">Once an inspection has been completed, transfer all the findings to a Follow-up report, which can be found in the Safety Committee binder. &nbsp; This report should be given to the general manager so that corrections can be made. &nbsp; Make a note next to each item that is a training issue so that this can be shared with the CEOs. &nbsp; </p>
<h1 class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Assignment </h1>
<p class="style3">Decide who will conduct the next three inspections. &nbsp; Write their names on the safety committee calendar that will be posted on the safety bulletin board. &nbsp; </p>
