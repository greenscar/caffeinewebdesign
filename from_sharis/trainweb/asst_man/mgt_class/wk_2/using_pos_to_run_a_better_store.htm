    <p class="style4">Many POS reports provide information that can raise a red flag in an area that may be getting out of control. &nbsp; The goal is to recognize the problem and address it before it has too much impact on the store. &nbsp; This is why many reports autosequence (print automatically) at the end of a shift, day, week or period. &nbsp; These aren't reports that we should just stuff in a binder, we need to look at them and see what they are trying to tell us. &nbsp; If you know what to look for, the time you spend reading reports can be minimal; leaving you more time to implement a solution. &nbsp; There are three main areas that POS reports can help us control. &nbsp; The areas are: product, cash and labor. &nbsp; Let's look at each area. </p></td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; The Menu Items Sales Summary and Key Item reports are most useful to track usage. &nbsp; The way to use these reports is to run the report at a given time, run it again after a certain amount of time has elapsed and then take inventory. &nbsp; This way you can determine if there is a variance between the amount used and sold. &nbsp; If you have a variance, you will need to do some investigation to determine if product was stolen, in which case you would begin setting up some security measures or if it was wasted, which may indicate a training issue. </p>
      <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; The Top 50 Report can also be a great tool for focused training – you can focus on the items that you sell the most of, making sure that all of your cooks know those standard. &nbsp; This should increase guest satisfaction, decrease waste and speed up production (all tasks that lead to running a better restaurant). &nbsp; </p>
    <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; The Critical Items report is most useful in determining the amount of high food cost items to prep – this helps reduce waste and also ensures that you have enough product on hand to serve your guests. </p></td>

    <td><span class="style4"><u>Cash</u> – The POS system tracks the income and dispersing of revenue in the form of cash-out transactions and discounts. &nbsp; At Shari's the average period shortage for the company is $5,500 or $56 per store. &nbsp; Discounts represent about 5% of sales or $1,300 of a store's average weekly sales. &nbsp; Discounts are always going to be an expense of doing business; we are not trying to eliminate them, but we do want to make sure that all discounts are legitimate. &nbsp; Reports that can help us analyze cash and discounts are the Shift Sales Log, the Manager's Authorization report and the Check Detail – Discount report. &nbsp; When viewing these reports we are looking at three trouble areas: Training issues, product issues and theft. </span></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Training Issues – viewing these report can point to areas where more training may be needed. &nbsp; For example, if there were a lot of food comps on the Manager Authorization Report for poor food quality, maybe our cook staff needs more training or supervision. &nbsp; If you find that discounts weren't processed correctly you can go to the Check Detail report and find out who closed the check and provide more training. </p>
      <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Product Issues – The Manager's Authorization report is a great tool for catching product issues. &nbsp; Perhaps those 3 comped steaks were not a training issue but were in reality poor product – you should talk to the cooks and find out. </p>
    <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Theft – Use the Managers Authorization report in conjunction with the Check Detail to help identify theft issues. &nbsp; Are all discounts and comps processed by one person? &nbsp; Do they seem appropriate; are there any trends or red flags? </p></td>

The Hourly Labor Control report compares guests counts from the previous week to the current week and it can help you determine when to keep people over or send them home early. &nbsp; It is important to realize, however, POS does not take into account the skill level of your employees – this is where your experience comes in. &nbsp; Never send someone home early because “the computer said you could” when you know that the crew has been struggling all night. &nbsp; The Clock-In status reports well tell you how long each employee has been working; a great tool for scheduling breaks. </p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; POS Flash – The POS Flash report provides a snapshot of the store's overall performance. &nbsp; You can compare the current period's report to the previous period's report to analyze performance. &nbsp; You can use this information as training focuses for the next period and to give “atta-boys” to the crew. &nbsp; You can also compare your performance against the company benchmarks in each area. </p>
      <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Suggestive Selling report – The Suggestive Selling report evaluates the performance of each server individually. &nbsp; When reviewing this report you should take into consideration the shift the server works. &nbsp; In other words, you should evaluate each server against his or her own performance from the last period. &nbsp; This is a good report to use for setting goals and encouraging steady improvement. </p>
    <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Theoretical Food Cost report – This report helps you analyze waste in your store. &nbsp;&nbsp; Theoretical food cost is the food cost percent your store would experience if every bit of food was accounted for either by sales or discounts (employees meals, honored discounts, comps etc.). &nbsp; The difference between theoretical and actual food cost is waste. &nbsp; Waste is accounted for in three ways: food was wasted (ends of the ham, poor quality soup thrown away or a can not scraped well), theft or discounting errors (for example, a guest's meal is remade but not coded as a re-cook). &nbsp; When the variance creeps up, you should look to see if your discounts have decreased and also watch employee practices looking for waste or possibly theft. </p></td>

    <p class="style4"> POS reports can provide motivation for us and for our crew. &nbsp; Everyone likes to know what the goal is and how they are doing. &nbsp; Performing well encourages us to keep striving and falling short spurs us to work harder. &nbsp; Make sure that you use POS reports as positive motivation, pointing out where improvement occurred and offer suggestions or gather your crew's ideas on how to improve in certain areas. &nbsp; Try not to use reports in a negative way, for example, “Store X can sell desserts, why can't you?”  Following are some ideas on how you can use reports to help motivate your crew.<br>

    <td colspan="2"><p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Run Contests – Running contests is a fun way to improve employee skill and awareness. &nbsp; Running contests used to be a very time-consuming project, but POS makes it easy. &nbsp; For example, with POS you can run a simple dessert contest for one shift; give the first server to sell a dessert $5, the next server top her sale (2 desserts) gets to take the $5 from her, the next server to top that (3 desserts) gets to take the $5. &nbsp; With POS you can run reports throughout the shift to keep them excited. &nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the shift, be sure to discuss the amount of desserts sold and point out how much they improved over previous shifts. &nbsp;&nbsp; Your Green Marketing Binder is full of contest ideas for all areas of the restaurant. </p>
    <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Reviews – At Shari's the POS system gathers information about each individual employee and creates a simple one-page review every 28 days. &nbsp; There are not many companies that provide that amount of feedback for their employees. &nbsp; This is a powerful development tool that sets us apart from our competitors. &nbsp; Managers who take the time required each month to prepare and present these reviews to their employees are truly making an investment in their store and using the POS system to help them manage. </p></td>

      <p class="style4">&#149;&nbsp; Guest check colors can also assist you with seating. &nbsp; If the restaurant is full, you can look at the “Open Check Screen” and determine what tables will most likely be leaving first. &nbsp; This is especially helpful when you are trying to seat large parties. </p>
