    <td valign="top">Did you know that the average cost of hiring an hourly employee at Shari's is about $1,300. This is the average cost regardless of how long they stay - one week, 10 years, it doesn't matter. Considering this cost, why do you suppose we make a poor hire? Does the employee suddenly change, did we miss something in the interview, or is it just fate? While we have no control over some things we can reduce the chances of making a poor hire if our interview techniques are top-notch. <br></td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">At Shari's we advocate a very systematic approach to interviewing. First we screen, second we gather information, third we evaluate the candidate and lastly, we verify information. Skip any step and the potential for a poor hire increases. In the real restaurant-world things happen - we crisis hire, we get unpredictably busy and the unexpected happens and as a result, we end up with a poor hire. At this point we have two choices - rehire or keep the poor employee. All too often the latter happens and we accept sub-standard performance which can bring down our entire crew. The purpose of this assignment is to make us familiar with Shari's interview process and the affects of not following the outlined procedures. Perhaps the more comfortable we are with the process, the less the bumps in the restaurant road will  affect our hiring. <br></td>

Since a formal interview takes about 1 hour of your time (set-up and interview), hopefully you've done a good job of reviewing the application and have conducted a short screening interview. This way you aren't wasting time interviewing an applicant who doesn't fit your needs. Today we are going to review the next three steps: sharing information, evaluating information and verifying information (reference check). </p>

This means that we conduct the interview in such a way that we draw out the applicant's behavior pattern by using specific types of questions, limiting our talking, increasing our listening and sticking to an interview plan. At this time open your Interviewing manual to Chapter Four - Conducting the Interview. Please read pages 4.2-4.8 before proceeding. <br>
