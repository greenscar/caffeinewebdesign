    <td colspan="2"><p>There are many rules and policies that apply to payroll functions at Shari's. Some of these are company policies and procedures, but the majority are Federal and State mandated. It is therefore very important that every manager be familiar with and understand all policies so that they may effectively train their employees and avoid lawsuits for the company.</p>
    <p>Today we will be reading pages 3.20-3.34 of the Time and Attendance chapter of your POS manual. This chapter will not only make you familiar with the rules and polices but also give you lots of ideas about working with your employees to make sure that they also understand the importance of following these guidelines. </p>
    <p>Go to your POS manual and complete the reading assignment.</p>
    <p>After completing the reading assignment complete the following activities to see how much you learned. </p>    </td>
