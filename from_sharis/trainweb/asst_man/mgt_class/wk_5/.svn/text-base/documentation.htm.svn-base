    <td colspan="2">When we think of the word &quot;documentation&quot; it typically brings a negative thought to our minds. This is because we are thinking of documentation as a disciplinary step, and while it's true that documentation is common when disciplining it is also used for operational and positive employee situations as well. To document something simply means to &quot;write it down&quot;. Having a written document help us evaluate employees, follow up on problems and analyze store performance and trends. Documentation comes in many forms, not just a statement written by a manager. Log books, employee compliments, reviews and POS reports are all forms of documentation. In this reading assignment we will be discussing why and what we document, forms and tools that we use to document and finally, a basic process for creating a written document.<br></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="484">From the employee's point of view, documentation is important in the sense that it guides their actions. When a policy or procedures is in writing there is typically little question about how a thing is to be done. Employees feel comfortable when they can &quot;see it in writing&quot;. At Shari's we use such things as the employee handbook, job descriptions, the orientation checklist, employee manuals and review forms as just a few of the documents used to convey how the job is to be done. <br>

    <td width="443"><p>From a manager's point of view, documentation is important as it ensures that the employee understands. It also gives the manager rules to live by that  make fair implementation of policies and procedures easier, after all, it's the written rule, and not necessarily the manager's quirk. This does however, put a large responsibility squarely on the manager's back. If we have a policy, the management team must meet the following criteria.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p align="center">Manager Responsibilities </p>
      <p><span class="style1">There must be a business reason for the policy</span> - this eliminates the use of subjective criteria and the tendency of some supervisors to use favoritism. </p>
      <p><span class="style2">The management team must follow the policy</span> - Once established, it must be followed uniformly by all levels of management. If the employer has a written policy but follows another unwritten policy the standard is the unwritten policy. For example, our policy is for employees to report to work on time. If a manager allows employee to be late with no consequences, the policy is that it is now acceptable for employees to be late for work. </p>
      <p><span class="style2">The management team must communicate the policy</span> - the employee's most common defense is that he/she allegedly did not know that rule or policy. </p>    
    <p><span class="style2">The management team must assure that all employees have an equal opportunity to meet the requirements</span> - Not providing the same opportunity for the employee creates both &quot;disparate impact&quot; and &quot;disparate treatment&quot;.</p>
    <p><span class="style2">There must be a consistent application of the standard</span> - Inconsistency and exceptions automatically lead to unequal treatment. </p>
    <p><span class="style2">Document and keep records</span> - Documentation is necessary to establish that the policy was applied firmly, fairly and consistently.<br>

      <p>Employee Defenses</p>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p><span class="style5">The dumbness defense:</span> &quot;No one ever told me.&quot; &quot;I never knew that rule.&quot; This is why it is so important to document initial training and the topics covered during orientation. Make sure that you are getting employee signatures on all of these documents.</p>
    <p><span class="style5">The comparison defense:</span> The employee admits to committing the violation. However, makes a comparison with another employee who committed the same violation such as &quot;Mickey is always late and nothing ever happens to them.&quot; As you can see it is so important for managers to discipline consistently and fairly.</p>
    <p><span class="style5">The &quot;no one ever said anything until&quot; defense:</span> This defense is coupled with the employee dong something such as suffering an industrial injury, making a safety complaint, protesting an employer's policy, etc. After the employee has done something the employer allegedly took action that was unfavorable to the employee. Before the employee did something, the employee's performance was acceptable. It is a common defense in sexual or racial harassment cases.</p>
    <p><span class="style5">The &quot;supervisor&quot; was out to get me defense:</span> This defense can be coupled with the above and is common in sexual and racial harassment complaints. This defense can be expanded so that the co-workers are also part of the conspiracy to &quot;get&quot; the employee. Managers must keep employee situations confidential amongst the management staff and also document all conversations. </p>
    <p><span class="style5">The &quot;supervisor watched me more closely&quot; defense:</span> The employee admits to committing the violation but it is coupled with an allegation that the supervisor watched him/her more closely than the other employees. Part of the defense is that the employer was waiting and watching for the opportunity to &quot;get rid of&quot; the employee. Unfortunately, this is a too common occurrence when managers wait to discipline employees because they need them to cover schedules. When the crisis ends, they begin the disciplining and documenting process. This never ends well for the company.</p>
    <p><span class="style5">The measurement of past performance with the current evaluation defense:</span> This defense is common in age discrimination cases where past performance appraisals have been good but the employee is being terminated because &quot;he/she has always been a marginal employee.&quot; The defense is also common in cases where the employee has been off work for some reason (maternity leave, industrial or non-industrial injury, lay off, etc.) The employer finds that the replacement is much more efficient and desirable and now doesn't want the employee back.</p>
    <p><span class="style5">The &quot;I did not get a fair chance&quot; defense:</span> This defense is common when an employee fails a probationary period or doesn't receive a promotion. It is critical that you work with your CEO's to document training and mangers need to be involved in the daily training process to ensure that the employees are receiving full and complete training.<br>

      <p align="left">It is important that you know that any form of documentation that we have can be subpoenaed by a court. It is therefore important that your documentation, regardless of the form you are using, be professional. You need to write neatly and spell correctly. In addition, make sure that your language is respectful, do not make flippant or derogatory remarks that you wouldn't want read in a court of law. Please use the following format when writing.<br>
        <br>
        1. Begin with a title statement about the purpose of the warning, for example: use of offensive language.</p>
      <p align="left">2. Next, write a statement of the problem or violation, for example: as of today, your offensive language has not ceased.</p>
      <p align="left">3. Prepare a statement explaining how the employee's action or performance had a negative impact on the store's operations, for example: The employees and guests at the restaurant are offended by your language. </p>
      <p align="left">4. Write a statement of Shari's policy, or customary standards regarding the situation, for example: This type of language is a direct violation of Shari's Codes of Conduct under General Offenses as listed in your employee handbook.</p>
      <p align="left">5. Next, list previous verbal or written warnings about the same or related problem, for example: On June 1, 2004, you were verbally warned....You have been counseled on this issue, told that it is not appropriate, and asked to stop many times: May 17, 2004; May 28, 2004; and today, June 9, 2004.</p>
      <p align="left">6. Write a summary of the agreement reached with the employee on corrective action to be taken, and the period of time fro corrective action to occur, or if no agreement was reached, a statement to that effect, for example: You agreed that you would be more careful and not use offensive language while at work.</p>
      <p align="left">7. Finally, write a statement of the next action management will take, for example: Should it continue, further disciplinary action will be taken, up to and including termination.</p>

      <p align="center" class="style7">Today's Date: 1/23/04</p>
      <p class="style7">Emeril is a good cook on swing shift. He excels in production covering many $1500 shifts. His plates look good and receives many compliments on his quality. However, he is messy. By the end of his shift, you cannot find the floor. He seldom completes his sidework and leaves your graveyard cook with empty drawers and a dirty half-filled steamtable. Despite intense efforts to correct his bad habits, he seems to be set in his ways. </p>
      <p class="style7">Just last night the graveyard cook (Julia) told you that once again when she took over for Emeril the line was in complete disarray and she had to stock up the line. You trust what Julia had told you. You had your best CEO (Wolfgang) work all day with Emeril last week (1/17/04). Wolfgang retrained him on organization, clean-as-you-go procedures and what to have ready for the next cook. Two days after this instance (1/19/04) your Assistant Manager (Kelly) wrote in the log that Emeril had returned to his bad habits and left the line a mess. </p>
      <p class="style7">You hired Emeril two months ago and he has been given full training. For a while he had kept the line clean and organized. Now this problem has become a habit. You need a fast cook but to keep him, as is, you may lose a dependable graveyard and destroy the morale of the crew. You have heard comments like <em>“Since he gets away with it why should we work so hard?” </em> from your crew. </p>    </td>
