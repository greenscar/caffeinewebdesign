    <p><u>Crisis</u>: There are some things in the office that we need rarely, but when we need them, we need them <strong>NOW</strong>. Items like an accident report, modified duty forms, insurance information and so on. These are usually times of crisis and you don't look very professional if you are desperately tearing apart your office to find needed information. <br>

      <p class="style2"><u>Enhance Your Reputation</u>: A manager who is organized looks more &quot;in control&quot; to outside vendors, guests and employees. It helps you to be seen as one who is competent and is able to handle situations. <br>

The assignment is two-fold: to see if we are missing items and to help us learn where things that we don't use very often are. To gain this information we will be conducting a Shari's Office Audit. After completing the audit we will be chatting with Kevin Jones of the shipping and receiving department. The goal of the shipping and receiving department is to provide the stores will all of their office needs so that managers don't spend time at the office supply store or copy center. </p>    </td>

For example, having a binder with forms and a scheduled routine for inventorying light bulbs, china and uniforms makes us efficient and gives us information to maintain a balance inventory and spend within budget rather than crisis ordering these items when needed. Completing the accounting functions shiftly and daily as outlined saves us time at the end of the week and we know exactly were we are on labor, sales and spending. Now check each items listed under Office Organization.</p>
