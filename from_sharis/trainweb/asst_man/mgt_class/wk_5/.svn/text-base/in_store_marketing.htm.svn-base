    <td colspan="2">At Shari's we use two types of marketing to attract new or existing customers: corporate marketing and local store marketing. Corporate marketing is mandatory, meaning the entire company participates. These marketing activities include newspaper and television advertising and promotions, coupons and discounts, and programs; such as table tents and pie of the month. Local marketing is handled at the store or district level and is designed and implemented by the store management staff. Local marketing is more individual and usually reflects the personality of the store location and staff. Typically, there are three types of local marketing: holidays and events, community involvement and guest and employee interaction (or FUN!).</td>

        <p>Planning Promotions </p>
        <p align="left">As with most things, designing and running a promotion takes planning and preparation. It is not something that you can just &quot;put together&quot; and hope it comes off well. Shari's has developed a Holiday and Chalkboard Specials binder to assist the management staff with this task. It is important to establish a budget before you begin planning a promotion so that you know what your limitations are. Some things to consider when planning  promotions are:</p>
        <p align="left"><u>Guest Involvement or Contest</u>: Decide if you are going to involve the guest in the promotion in some way. Are they going to fill out trivia sheets on Shari's anniversary, will they enter a drawing for a prize, bring in a coupon or sing for their free coffee? If you decide to involve the guest make sure that your activity is appropriate and that you prepare your employees well. They will most likely be the person who explains to the guests. Try to be creative, guest involvement can be fun when well thought out and planned. </p>
        <p align="left"><u>Employee Involvement or Contest</u>: Decide if you will have something special for your employees during the promotion. You can run a contest or simply focus on excellent guest service - for example, pass out Shari's bucks when you &quot;catch&quot; employees giving exceptional service. Buy small prizes that they can purchase with their Shari's bucks. Also think of ways to create interaction between the guest and employees to build customer relations. For example, you may have something that the employees can give to the guests for participating. Again, planning in advance is a key.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>Advertising</u>: There are several ways that you can advertise. Local papers are usually affordable - just make sure that you have your DM's approval. You can also advertise in the store a week or two before the event using flyers, the chalkboard and word-of-mouth from your employees. You may also want to partner with fellow merchants who may help you by advertising to their guests. </p>
        <p align="left">Decorations: There are many ways that you can decorate the restaurant for not a lot of expense. Consider:</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li>Interior -Balloons, streamers, and holiday cutouts are all inexpensive and some can be saved from year to year. Make sure that decorations don't interfere with the work flow, are not offensive (Halloween can sometimes cause problems) and that they are colorful and cheery.</li>
            <li>Pie Case: Don't forget the pie case, it is one of the biggest display tools that you have. </li>
            <li>Uniforms: You may want to allow the staff to support the promotion by wearing a different uniform for the day. For example: a football jersey on Super bowl day or Hawaiian shirts for a summer promotion.</li>
            <li>Plates: It is also possible to decorate the plates. For example, you might use a small flag on a toothpick to decorate all plates on the Fourth of July.</li>
            </ul>

    <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><p>Meal Specials: You will want to have a meal special for most holiday promotions. Here are some things to consider when planning the menu.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Think of the Season: During the winter holidays, guests are more willing to eat rich heavy specials like meat dishes but during the summer fish and salads go better.</li>
          <li> Will it Conflict: Think about what is on special right now. You don't want to run an inexpensive dish-up special against a $10.99 table tent steak promotion, it will hurt your PPE. You might consider combining items for value and a high ticket average, for example, dinner including dessert.</li>
          <li>Consider Your Cook Staff: Are they newer and less experienced?A complicated special may actually hurt your store if they get overwhelmed. On the other hand, if you have experienced cooks, they may enjoy helping you plan  specials.</li>
          <li>Consider the Ingredients Used: Are they all in-house? We have a large inventory of various products on hand. Think of the walk-in, freezer and storeroom as your grocery store. Be creative, remember our regular guests are looking for something new.</li>
          <li>Plan to Run Out: It is OK to run out of a special. That simply means that it was successful. Try not to have a lot left over that you will have to figure out what to do with.</li>

    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" valign="middle"><p>Holidays and events can be broken down into three categories: national holidays, such as Christmas, personal celebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries and local promotions such as a community parade or mall sale. </p>
      <p><u>National Holidays</u>: The corporate Research and Development department will provide promotions for some holidays, but typically it is left to the management staff to develop or augment holiday promotions. Usually, these types of holidays will not be promoted with advertising, we are basically trying to provide a festive occasion and variety for our regular guests. Typically, our guests are not looking for a bargain on these  holidays - so keep that in mind when you are decided on specials to run. Also consider that these days are busier than normal so make sure that your special don't hamper the flow of service - high-ticket simple specials are best.</p>
      <p><u>Personal Celebrations</u>: Were you surprised to find that the number one event celebrated in restaurants was birthdays? Since this is true wouldn't it be wise for each restaurant to have a standard way to celebrate a guest's birthday. Typically, everyone disappears so they don't have to sing! It would be a great store project to involve the crew and come up with a unique way to celebrate birthdays: a unique birthday song, a stock of cards the crew could sign, or a special dessert or birthday hat. These are the types of things a guest remembers that influences their daily dining decision.</p>
      <p><u>Local Events</u>: Local promotions are a great way to receive some extra guest traffic at little or no cost. Try to develop a promotion that fits the theme of the celebration using the Planning Promotions list above. A common mistake made by managers during this type of promotion is under-staffing. It is truly a shame to bring in new guests only to disappoint them with poor service or food quality. </p></td>

Outright donations are handled by our marketing department and you should refer any such requests to them. Request for prizes can be handled by the management staff. You should review each request and determine if it will benefit your restaurant or standing in the local community. <br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" valign="middle"><u>Cross Promotions</u>: Cross promotions are partnerships with other local businesses - they give you something, you give them something. This is a great way to aquire gifts and rewards to give to your staff for in-store contests or recognition. For example, you may trade a dinner for two for free movie rentals from the local video store. Cross promotions may also involve mutual advertising for non-competing businesses (those that don't sell food).<br>
      <br>
      <u>Community Presence</u>: Developing a community presence is getting your name and face recognized in your area. This can take time but can reap great results. Perhaps you can start by taking a pie to the bank the next time you make a deposit, introducing yourself to one business owner a week, or joining your mall association or local chamber of commerce.</td>

These can be simple things such as bringing in cookies for the crew or having the crew bring in baby pictures and guessing who each one is. They can also involve sales and performance goals. For example: you might try to beat the store's highest sales record for Christmas or lower food cost for a period. All of these types of promotions help the employees feel a as though they are a part of the restaurant and valued for their contribution. </td>
    </tr>

      <td colspan="2" valign="middle">Fun promotions can also involve the guests in such activities as playing Shari's trivia, voting on a favorite pie type or singing their favorite Elvis song on Elvis' birthday. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" valign="middle"><br>
        As you can see, promotions can be simple or involved but all take a lot of planning. Some managers may question if it is worth it - and that is a good question with no black and white answer. In some cases, the results can be easy to see, for example: we sold X number of specials at a certain price or increased sales or guest counts over last week or last year. Sometimes, results are a little harder to determine. For example: what is one guest worth who has a great experience on their birthday and comes in more often and brings other people? What is a positive employee attitude worth? All are interesting questions that you should consider when you are deciding upon the goals and worth of your in-store promotions.</td>
