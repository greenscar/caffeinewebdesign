    <td>This week we have been focusing on food cost control. Monday we looked at portions and quality using the PPQC form. Tuesday we looked at waste using a Trash Audit. Today we will be looking at a Food Cost Audit. At Shari's, the Food Cost Audit is typically used when a store is having a food cost issue. It is done more on a random basis rather than an a regularly scheduled basis. </td>

    <td colspan="2"><p> Of the three tools we've studied, the Food Cost Audit is the most comprehensive. It goes beyond portions and waste,  looking at server and cook habits as well as receiving and storing practices. The Food Cost Audit really helps us identify and pinpoint how waste happens.<br>
        <br>
    Print out this assignment now. As you read each section we will be moving around the restaurant and looking at different areas. Most likely you will not get everything done during class and will be completing a portion of this assignment during your shift while you are working the floor.</p>    </td>

    <td colspan="2"><p align="center">Food Cost Audit - Ticket Control System</p>
      <p align="left">The food cost audit is broken down into sections of the restaurant. The first section deals with guest checks. In this section we are really looking to see that all items are entered into the computer and that all checks are making it to the register. Here are some suggestions of things to look for: </p>
      <p align="left"><u>Red Checks followed up on</u>: When a ticket turns red, this is your signal that something could be wrong. At the very least we want to check and see if the food is taking too long. Many times you will find that the table has left - you need to follow up up with the server right away. We always want to believe that our employees are honest, but it is not uncommon for a guest to leave their money on the table and it is just too tempting to not cash out the check. If your servers know that you follow up, they are less likely to try keeping the cash. You should veiw each ticket that isn't cashed out at a missing $14.50 ($7.25 PPE times 2) our average guest check. </p>
      <p align="left"><u>Guest Counts Match Meals</u>: Since labor hours are based on guest counts, inaccurate guest counts do have an affect on labor. The can also signal a server giving away food or trying to improve their statistics. </p>
      <p align="left"><u>Checks Presented With Meals</u>: You should worry when a guest has to ask you for a check - how many of them will take the time? Also, watch for servers who offer to cash out the guest's check, you want to be sure that transaction makes it to the register.</p>
      <p align="left"> <u>Discounts Stapled to Ticket Stubs</u>: All discounts must be accounted for. Are your employees discounting properly (honored meals, coupons)?</p>
      <p align="left"><u>All Food on Tickets</u>: This one is HUGE. If each server leaves one item off a ticket either on purpose or intentionally the effect is disastrous. Same theory as replacing the food lost in the trash (yesterday's assignment). To catch these errors we use a system called &quot;table audits&quot;. Walk by a table and note the items present. Look specifically for items that don't come from the kitchen (beverages and desserts). Now, go to a POS terminal and bring up the check. Is everything on it? If not, counsel the server - they will be as careful as you make them be.</p>
      <p align="left"><u>Employees Meals</u>:  Is the employee meal system followed? Are employees eating without tickets, are tickets cashed out at the time of the break - lots of was to lose food here.</p>
      <p align="left"><u>Comps</u>: Do you follow up with servers and cooks when you have a comp? If you blindly accept the fact that we have comps and never follow up with your employees your comps will creep higher and higher.</p>
      <p align="left">Now, complete this section of the audit - you may need to observe some items later while you are in charge of the floor.<br>

      <p>Food Cost Audit - Food Quality Section</p>
      <p align="left">This section of the Food Cost Audit looks at items that are portioned on the line as they are used - for example: how much oil are the cooks using for hash browns, how much cheese is really in an omelette, how much lettuce is in a salad and so on. It is best to evaluate these times as you are working the floor by looking at plates (expediting) as they come up in the cook window. As plates come up try to evaluate plates from each section of the menu. Write as many notes as you can so that it is easier to follow up later.<br>

      <p>Food Cost Audit - Deliveries</p>
      <p align="left">One reason that we have standard times to accept deliveries is so that the manager will be free to check them in; looking for both quality and quantity. It is also important to have our employees free so they can put the order away immediately so the food doesn't lose quality by sitting out. In this section you will also want to evaluate your security system - a typical Shari's has between $7,000 and $12,000 of inventory at any given time - that's a lot of food to watch!<br>

      <p>Food Cost Audit - Server Alley</p>
      <p align="left">You may not realize it, but servers handle and portion a lot of food. Most of the food in the kitchen is pre-portioned and accounted for on tickets. The servers have access to a lot of food for which there is no accounting. </p>
      <p align="left"><u>Salads</u>:Take a close look as salad portioning - we don't want to skimp and we can always get a guest more if they ask. Just because they ask for extra dressing doesn't mean we take it in a soup cup! </p>
      <p align="left"><u>Milk</u>: Are bags being completely drained before a new bag is put in place? Servers tend to get impatient when the milk is running slow - if there is any milk left in the bag it can be given to the cooks to use in soup.</p>
      <p align="left"><u>Soup</u>: Check soup portioning and quality. Are soups being reconstituted as they condense with heat.</p>
      <p align="left"> <u>Coffee</u>: Weigh a drop of grounds for each type of coffee. Regular coffee should weigh 1.75 ounces and decaf should weigh 2 ounces. Temperature is also important for proper flavor. </p>
      <p align="left"><u>Expedite</u>: Observe the server prepping plates. Are they using proper portions for butter, sour cream, sauces, bread and so on. </p>
      <p align="left"> <u>Dessert Area</u>: Observe the server preparing desserts and cutting pie. Look for proper portions and storage. Also look for the full use of product, are ice cream tubs scraped, whipped cream can shaken to get full use, are they draining the juice off the berries thereby diluting the mix?</p>
