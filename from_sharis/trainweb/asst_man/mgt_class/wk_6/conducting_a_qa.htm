    <td colspan="2"><p>The term QA stands for Quality Assurance Inspection. QA's are conducted once a quarter (4 times a year) by your district manager. When most people hear that a QA is coming, they immediately begin thinking about cleaning and sanitation. Our employees sigh heavily and stand in line for deep cleaning projects, sidework inspections and eagerly await the newly designed Mr. Clean program. While the QA inspection does take a close look at cleanliness and sanitation - it is so much more. The purpose of a QA is really to evaluate the manager's systems for operating the restaurant. The QA centers around four major areas: Facilities, Customer Service, Food Quality and Operations Organization.<br>

Your DM knows the difference between &quot;old&quot; dirt and &quot;new&quot; dirt. They can see past the all-night cleaning party as they will be looking at the systems that keep the restaurant clean (sidework and Mr. Clean) and how those systems are incorporated into  day-to-day operations and how they are followed up on. In addition they will also be looking at sanitation practices involving food handling, chemical use and employee habits (such as handwashing). Lastly they will inspect the building and equipment for needed repairs. <br></td>

This gives a good representation of all the areas mentioned above; facilities, customer service food quality and organization. At this time you should print out this assignment and take it to each area as you inspect. Write notes as you inspect each area. Later, we will be meeting in the chat room to discuss our findings.<br></td>

    <p><span class="style1"><u>Sanitation Equipment</u>: Check for evidence of regular cleaning, all equipment should be sanitized and free of loose food particles. The knife holder is a great place to look for &quot;old&quot; dirt.</span></p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Sanitation Practices</u>: It is a managers responsibility to provide the tools needed - are there enough wiping cloths? Are they in good condition - or past their usefulness? Do the cooks change the bleach water at least hourly? Chemicals, including bleach used to make bleach water must be stored away from food. Also, cooks should only be prepping one item at a time.</p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Sanitation Employees</u>: Look for evidence of eating or drinking in the prep area. Also, look for evidence of frequent handwashing: initials on the handwashing log, plenty of paper towel and soap at the handsink. Do employees wash their hands after break?Do sick employees seem to be working. Is there an eye wash attachment at the sink?</p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Organization</u>: Is the prep sheet kept on a standard form or on a paper towel? Does the cook prioritize the prep list or simply prepare the easiest items first. Are we low on product, can the cook prep everything needed?</p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Storage Organization</u>: Are the prep utensils in good condition? Is it easy to find what you need? Is the area clean?</p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Ceiling</u>: Does the ceiling receive regular cleaning? Are the vents dusty or greasy. Is there food on the ceiling? When was the ceiling painted last?</p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Lights</u>: All lights should be burning. Are there light bulbs in the store inventory? Dead bugs in the diffusers would indicate a lack of regular cleaning. Diffusers crack with age and are sometimes damaged when taken down - do some need to be replaced?</p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Walls</u>: Dried on food would indicate a lack of regular cleaning. Walls that have a good coat of paint and have had gouges repaired are easier to keep clean.</p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Floor</u>: Look for cracked and damaged tile. Floors should be grease free and the grout should not be black. Are the DMOs using separate mop buckets for front and back of house. Are the DMOs using proper mopping procedures?<br>

      <p><u>Floor Drain</u>: Drains should be free of debris. Lack of a grease scum would indicate regular cleaning. Regular removal of food and drain cover and screen cleaning keeps drains odor free. </p>
      <p><u>Slicer</u>: When was the blade sharpened last? Is there a blade cover? Are serviceable mesh gloves present? Is the slicer well maintained - parts move easily.</p>
