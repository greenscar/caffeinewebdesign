      <h3 align="center" class="style6"><em>Counter Attacking </em> (become defensive) </h3>
      <p align="left" class="style5">They use sarcasm and put-downs or resort to snapping. This does not help to build a relationship with the critic, so the real issue is seldom dealt with. Future relationships with the critic are prejudiced. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style5">If you have a tendency to counter attack, make sure you do not respond immediately to criticism. Let the critic know that you have heard their view and would like to consider it for a while before responding. This will give you time to gather your thoughts and respond calmly and objectively. </p>

      <p>.... and walking away from the criticism silently. This response causes people to lose respect for you and you may never find out what the critic really intended. </p>
      <p>If you have a tendency to walk away from criticism, try the following behaviors: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tell the critic you are <em>uncomfortable </em> with criticism in public (the company of anyone else). Ask them to arrange private meetings with you to discuss any problems they have with your performance or behavior.</li>
        <li>Ask if you could meet with the critic to discuss a <em>personal development plan </em>. Ask them to jot down the main issues and give you time to consider them before any discussions </li>
        <li>Ask a colleague you trust for <em>advice </em> about how you could deal with a particularly difficult critic </li>
        <li>Take <em>assertiveness </em> training. </li>
        <li> Don't be thin-skinned. <br>
    The individual offering feedback is not attacking you personally, they're trying to help you create a better photograph. (This only applies to honest attempts at criticism. While you should still try to avoid being thin-skinned since you're putting your work out there for everyone to see, there are also going to be times when people simply say idiotic things in order to prove themselves morons. Know this and try to ignore it.) </li>
        <li>Ask for clarification. <br>
    If you don't understand a point being made, or if it is too generic to offer any real help, ask for additional information or possible solutions to help you better understand what the person is trying to say. </li>
        <li>Acknowledge your mistakes. <br>
    The guy in the background has a tree growing out of his head, you didn't see it yourself, and someone else pointed it out. Note the error, fix it if you can (don't fixate), learn from it, and move on. </li>
        <li>Assume best intentions. <br>
    A comment from another may seem nit picky to you, but if the other person points something out, they thought it was important enough to mention. Treat it as an important item, even if you decide to ignore it. <br>
        </li>

To determine if criticism is valid you should ask: </p>      <ol>
        <li>Is this something I have heard before from others? </li>
        <li>Is the critic an expert in this field? </li>
        <li>Does the critic have reasonable standards? </li>
        <li>Is the criticism really about me, or is the critic upset about something else and taking it out on me? </li>
        <span class="style1"></span>
    </ol>      <h3 align="center"><strong><em>Stage 3: Action </em></strong></h3>      <p>Decide what you need to do about the criticism.

Then work with the critic to identify the most appropriate response. </p>      <p>Make sure you identify the cause of the problem, not just the symptoms. </p>
    <p class="style1"><em>For example: </em></p>
    <p><strong><em>A</em></strong><em> criticism that you are not coaching your staff effectively may not require coaching training. The cause might be that you are overworked - too busy to spend sufficient coaching time with them. </em></p></td>

    <p>The best response to invalid criticism is <em>calm acknowledgement </em> that you have <em>heard </em> the criticism and would like some <em>specific evidence </em>. </p>
    <p><strong>Say: </strong></p>
    <p>&quot; <em>What exactly did I do that concerns you? </em>&quot; <strong><br>
  Or <br>
</strong>&quot; <em>What specifically should I do differently in the future? </em>&quot; <strong><br>
Or <br>
</strong>&quot; <em>I'm not sure I'm clear about your complaint </em>&quot;. <strong><br>
Or <br>
</strong>You could politely disagree. </p>
    <h3 align="center"><strong>Practice Makes Perfect </strong></h3>
    <p>Finally remember that to remedy a problem with receiving negative feedback you will need to change your behavior. It is not a skill problem, it is a <em>behavioral</em> one, and ignoring it will not make it go away. This means that you need to practice your behaviors regularly. </p>
    <p>This will be difficult to begin with, but with practice, the appropriate behaviors will become &quot;natural&quot; to you. </p>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p align="center"><strong>How to Give Feedback</strong></p>      <p><strong>1. Help people save face. </strong><br>
    Don't mock or attack someone for having made a mistake (even as a joke). Instead, point out the problem or mistake, offer suggestions for fixing or improving it and move on. </p>      <p><br>
          <strong>2. Focus on specific, observable behavior-not judgment or personality. </strong><br>
  Instead of making a statement of judgment, like, &quot;What a loser,&quot; or &quot;This stinks,&quot; point out the specific problem. For example, &quot;Since we are a 24 hour restaurant it is vital that each person completes their side work to standard. </p>      <p><br>
          <strong>3. Don't generalize. </strong><br>
  General comments may show that you caught a mistake, but don't say exactly where it is or offer any suggestions on how to fix it. Instead of &quot;You did not do your side work&quot; try, &quot;You seem to be in a real hurry to get out at your scheduled time off. This prevents you from doing a thorough job of completing your side work. Some portions of your side work can be completed during your shift and kept up through out your shift. This will allow you more time to do a thorough job during the shift and also save you time at the end of your shift.&quot;</p>      <p><br>
          <strong>4. Tell people when errors exist. </strong><br>
  Don't be afraid of pointing out mistakes. If you don't tell people when they've done something wrong, how can they do it right the next time? </p>      <p><br>
          <strong>5. Avoid nitpicking. </strong><br>
  The objective is to teach with a thoughtful comment-not to humiliate or discount people and their work. </p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p><strong>6. Don't wait for annual reviews.<br>
 </strong>Discuss problem behavior each time it happens rather than saving up a batch of criticisms for a scheduled appraisal. Unloading once a year will seem punitive, not developmental, because employees will feel they weren't given a chance to improve. <strong><br>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>7. Reinforce changed behavior. <br>
      </strong>When an employee pays attention to criticism and improves, say something like &quot;I was impressed at how you handled yourself at the table. You were very polite and knowledgeable.&quot; Managers can be reluctant to deliver such praise because they don't want to get into another discussion about the behavior or because they're afraid of sounding condescending. Forget about sounding condescending. Employees love it when you notice that there is a change. </td>
