Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company&hellip; a church&hellip; a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past&hellip; we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing that we can do is to play on the one string we have and that is our attitude&hellip; I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you&hellip; we are in charge of our attitudes</span></p>

  In determining how we face life it is our attitude that is the key. See whether or not you agree with the following statement. <br>
  <br>
&quot;You are responsible for all of your experiences of life.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  This statement is absolutely true but it is somewhat of a trick. The trick is that it does not say &quot;in life&quot; but &quot;of life.&quot; You are not responsible for everything that happens to you, but you are responsible for how you react to what does happen to you. The formula is that, &quot;Life acts. You react.&quot; Your reaction is under your control. In any life situation you are always responsible for at least one thing. You are always responsible for the attitude towards the situation in which you find yourself. Your attitude is your reaction to what life hands you. You can have either a more positive or a more negative attitude. Your attitude is under your control and can be changed. With the right attitude you can be a resilient person.</span></div></td>

      <p><strong>It is easier to change the way you think than your emotions. </strong></p></td>
      <td width="514"><p align="left" class="style3">What is an attitude? An attitude is a point of view about a situation. An attitude has three components. An attitude is made up of: </p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li class="style3">What you think. </li>
              <li class="style3">What you do. </li>
              <li class="style3">What you feel. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left" class="style3">No matter what situation you are in you always have certain thoughts about it. You also have an emotional response to it, and you behave a certain way in it. To begin changing your attitude you either change your thinking, the way you act, or the way you feel. Two of these choices are easier to influence than the third. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">It is easier to change the way you think or behave than to change your emotions. However, it is usually our emotions that get our attention in regard to the situation. It is our emotions that we most want to change. When we feel sad, angry, anxious, or frustrated we don't like it. We want the feeling to quickly go away. So we start trying to change the emotion. We often begin by trying to change others so we can feel better. It doesn't work. We engage in behaviors like alcohol and drug abuse to numb the feelings. It doesn't work. Working all the time or excessive shopping are attempts at avoiding emotional distress. They don't work, although the shopping might be a lot of fun. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">Our initial tendency is to focus on the feeling level and to change it first. The feeling or emotional level, however, is the most difficult to work on. You can't &quot;grasp&quot; a feeling and force it to change. Feelings are powerful but vague. You cannot get a grip on a feeling. If you want to change your feelings you must start elsewhere. You must begin with either your thinking or your behavior over which you have more control. The secret in effectively changing your emotions is knowing that feelings, thoughts, and behaviors are all related. When you change one of them ( for example, thinking) the other two (feelings and behavior) will change as well. Since it is easier to get a &quot;grasp&quot; on thoughts and behavior this is the place to begin your work of staying resilient. Change what you think! Change what you do! The emotions will change and you will be creating resiliency. </p></td>

      <p align="center"><strong>To change your attitude, change your mind. </strong></p>      </td>
      <td width="514" valign="top"><p align="left" class="style3">You are responsible for your thinking. Change your thinking and life will get better. But, what thoughts do you change? Your troublesome thoughts about a situation can easily be found in your self-talk. Self-talk is that inner running dialogue you have with yourself. It is what you tell yourself about life's situations. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">All of us have a voice that talks to us. You might think of it as your conscience. It might be that &quot;inner observer&quot; who seems to sit in the corner and watch everything you do. You may recognize it as that voice that starts talking to you upon awakening in the morning. Sometimes it may wait until you look in the mirror before it actually speaks. It is that voice that says, &quot;You sure are handsome.&quot; or &quot;What a wonderful person you are.&quot; Or &quot;You are going to have a great day.&quot; It might say, &quot;You are so slim and your hair looks beautiful.&quot; If you don't recognize this voice then yours may be speaking to you in a different tone. You might be hearing, &quot;You look like crap today&quot; or &quot;You sure have gained a lot of weight.&quot; &quot;Your hair is a mess.&quot; &quot;It's  a terrible day! Get back in bed.&quot; This voice, the negative, critical one, is one of the main reasons we have so many problems. It can destroy resiliency by opening the flood gates and draining away your energy. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">This voice can make anything worse. You may be like most people and know how to take any small problem, think about it for awhile, and have a bigger problem. That little voice keeps telling you what might go wrong. All of the dark possibilities are pointed out. The imagination creates a very bad situation. The problem goes from a mild annoyance to a major catastrophe as you convince yourself that the imagined situation is the real situation. You are now busy confronting a problem that only exists in your mind.&nbsp; There are enough existing problems in our day -to - day living, we don't need to waste time and effort on the imagined situations.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">Any response, at this point, is going to be out of proportion to the original problem. The normal reaction to the original problem is most likely some degree of emotional distress. If your spouse has been laid off from a job, you may be feeling some combination of tense, worried, anxious, sad, irritated, frustrated, or angry. All of these are normal emotions for the experience. However, that inner voice may be busy exaggerating, &quot; This is horrible and terrible. It is the world's worst thing. Good jobs are so hard to find. He/She feels so hopeless and helpless. No one will ever hire them. You won't be able to pay your bills. You will lose everything you have. You should just give up.&quot; With such a running dialogue you will soon fall into depression or become enraged at your imagined misfortune. In a deep depression you may decide that the situation is hopeless and become even more depressed. In a state of depression you may act in an inappropriate, rude manner towards your staff and or supervisor. Either reaction is too intense because the response is to a situation you have created in your mind. Change your mind, your attitude, and the problem can shrink back to its original size. The original problem may be bad enough but it is not the catastrophe you have invented. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">To change your attitude you must change the inner dialogue. To change the dialogue you must catch it in action. To do this you have to pay attention to yourself. You must engage in self-observation and listen for that inner voice. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">The next time that you find yourself feeling &quot;bad&quot; don't start asking, &quot;Who did this to me?&quot; Don't start looking around for the external cause of your problems. What you should do is to ask yourself, &quot;What have I been thinking?&quot; &quot;What have I been telling myself?&quot; You may find that your inner dialogue has put you deep into emotional distress all because you did not pay attention to the direction your mind was taking you. </p></td>

      <p>Remember, a mistake is the first step in learning. </p></td>
      <td width="514" valign="top"><p align="left" class="style3">Every society has rules for interpreting life. These rules explain the way things are. Some rules help you create and maintain resiliency and other rules hinder you. A common rule in our society is that, &quot;Mistakes are bad.&quot; Following this rule you try not to make any mistakes because if you do, it means that you too are bad. You try to be perfect. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">Let's say you adopted the rule, &quot;Mistakes are bad&quot;. While working on a project (fixing a table, baking, or completing a work assignment) it did not turn out as expected. Somewhere along the way a mistake was made. Once the mistake is discovered that inner voice starts talking and you hear, &quot;Well, look at this. You really screwed up. Why do you even bother to try. You should just give up.&quot; Soon you begin to feel miserable. Your mood plummets. You are angry and frustrated and ready to give up. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">If someone comes along, finds you in despair, and asks what is wrong, you might say, &quot;Well look at the pie I was making. See how it's topped. It is all wrong.&quot; You are suggesting that the pie is responsible for your mood. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">What has actually brought about your distress? Was it the mistake you made or your reaction to the mistake? The answer is that it was your reaction to the mistake. It was the negative inner dialogue that you engaged in. All that inner criticism upset you. A mistake is just an event and there can be many possible reactions to it. The reactions all depend upon what you think the mistake means. What you think the mistake means depends on your rule for mistakes. Many of us learn that a mistake is a bad thing and a sign of failure. Our rule says simply that, &quot;Mistakes are bad. If you make one then you are bad.&quot; </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">This is just one rule. There are other points of view. So, we learn by making mistakes. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">A mistake is actually the first step in learning. When trying to learn something that is new to you, the learning comes from making a mistake and correcting it. If you make no mistakes, you don't learn. So mistakes are not bad, they are good. The next time that you make a mistake become excited and say to yourself, &quot;This is great. I am going to learn something now!&quot; Try this &quot;rethinking&quot; approach to any problem and your mood and behavior will improve. </p></td>

      <td width="514" valign="top"><p align="left" class="style3">Paying attention to what you think means that you practice the process of self-observation. You try and catch that inner voice as it speaks to you. What is it saying? Is it helpful or not? Learn to recognize the critical voice. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">If you try this process of self-observation your first experience will most likely be to hear that voice saying, &quot;Well, damn, you did it again.&quot; You will catch yourself after the fact. You will catch the voice after it has been speaking for sometime and you are already in the midst of a negative reaction. You may have been severely criticizing yourself for a mistake. You may have been listening to how exaggeratedly &quot;horrible&quot; an annoying but innocuous situation is. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">Whenever you hear that voice saying, &quot;Well damn, you did it again&quot; you should congratulate yourself. You have made a lot of progress because always in the past you would have listened to that negative inner dialogue and never even know that you did it. You would think that it was normal. Progress is when you are observant enough to catch what you have been doing. You catch yourself after the act. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">Now, you just keep observing and soon the inner voice says, &quot;Here you are doing it again.&quot; And, you go ahead and do it. Progress has been made because you now find yourself in the act but are not yet able to stop. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">More progress is seen when you hear the voice saying, &quot;Well, you are about to do it again.&quot; Once more you continue with the thinking and criticize yourself for the mistake. You are, however, becoming more mindful. You are catching yourself in the act sooner and sooner. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">Eventually, with a lot of hard work, you will hear, &quot;Look out. You are about to do it one more time.&quot; At this point you choose not to proceed. You don't begin the negative dialogue but intentionally begin a positive one. You hear, &quot;Mistakes are good. Now you can learn. Let's try it again and see what happens.&quot; You are now getting out of the negative pattern and consciously shaping your reaction to life events. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style3">When you listen to your inner dialogue and choose the more positive and realistic attitude you become a resilient person. Remember: Attitude is the key to resiliency. </p></td>

It starts at one end and flows to each and every kernel until the whole cob is covered. Don't underestimate the impact you have on your crew. If you show up and are not smiling and acknowledging each and every member of the staff the rumors start. &quot;Watch out, you want to stay away from ____ today, are they in a mood!&quot; Everyone realizes we have a life outside of work, but we need to leave our problems outside the workplace. This can be difficult and if you feel it is not possible you will need to talk with your supervisor. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">Your guests can tell when they walk into the restaurant when the work environment is comfortable, efficient and friendly by noticing the attitudes of workers. There is more laughter and smiles. Employees are more tolerant of each other. There is just that &quot;Feeling&quot; in the air. Work is viewed more as a challenge than as a series of tasks or interuptions. Negative attitudes can turn all this sour and chase those customers away before you even have the chance to serve them.</p>        </td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="2"><p align="left" class="style3">In the work environment, as in your personal life, it is your attitude that makes the difference . Building and maintaining healthy relationships among supervisors and co-workers is the key to success in any organization. Nothing contributes more to this process than a positive attitude. </p>
          <p align="left" class="style3">When positive, you transmit friendly signals. Customers, co-workers and supervisors are more open to you. Your attitude is expressed before you say a word. It shows in the way you look, stand, walk and talk. If you are cheerful and upbeat, your attitude acts like a magnet. You not only attract others, but they are more friendly toward you because they sense in advance that you already like them. </p>
          <p align="left" class="style3">Some individuals downgrade the importance of building and maintaining good human relations. So much emphasis is placed on the technical skills that they ignore the human issues. As a result, they have difficulty understanding why others often lack enthusiasm for their work although it is <strong><em>technically</em></strong> correct. One of the top reasons managers fail is that they cannot get their employees to do what they need them to do. Is this because they don't know how, don't want to do it or are not able to do it? Or is it because the employee takes on the attitude of &quot;Why should I?&quot; or &quot;What's in it for me?&quot; Where does this attitude come from? Wouldn't you like your employees to do exactly as you asked? Do you have the attitude that promotes that kind of dedication and respect from your staff? How would you feel if your staff was willing to do anything you asked of them quickly and with a smile. Earn the respect and dedication of your employees and you may not even have to ask. You can do this by having a good, strong, positive attitude of a teamplayer who wants to develop a winning team. </p>
          <p align="left" class="style3">Along with good work skills, career success depends on the quality of working relationships. An important first step is the development of a good attitude. If you don't look for the best in fellow workers, you are less apt to find it. As a result, you will not become the kind of manager Shari's wants you to be. Your personal productivity may remain high, but you will not be contributing as much as you could to the productivity of the organization.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style3">The well known saying that &quot;no man is an island&quot; is true. We all need other people. This is especially true in the workplace. Those who build a strong network of supporters create their own attitude reinforcement program. How great is it that you are surrounded by people to help keep you in a good mood? It is especially important in this business. You deal with guest and employee attitudes every shift you work. Often it is possible to turn a day that starts off poorly into one that is bright, simply because a fellow employee is in a good mood. Attitudes are truly infectious. </p></td>

      <tr>
        <td colspan="2"><p align="left" class="style3"><img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="44" height="41">Confidence: Can you be confident and persuasive if you are not optimistic? I don't believe so. The confident person believes in his or her abilities and strides forward with the expectation of success. Your staff and supervisors can see and feel that confidence. Negativity breeds doubt and hesitancy. Confidence builds success. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Persisitence: You have to have a positive attitude to believe you will succeed and keep trying. How many times did you get back on that bike before you were able to stay on it? Giving up just leads to failure. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Resiliency: If you are a positive person you will only temporarily be frustrated with a circumstance or situation. You focus on correcting the situation, learning from it and you bounce back and try again.<br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Courage: Believe you can and move forward with courage. Set the example for your staff. Change is always going to occur. Your staff feeds off of your attitude. If you grasp hold of change and run with it your staff is more likely to embrace the change. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Enthusisasm and Energy: A good positive attitude helps build enthusiasm and energy. Customers can sense that enthusisam and energy. Of course you can over do enthusiasm and energy so be careful. Direct the over enthusiastic or energetic personality so as not to offend anyone. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Health: The cells of your body actually come alive when you are positive. A negative attitude can make a person physically ill and not want to come to work. It is amazing what the human brain can do. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Encouraging others: You have faith in the ability of others and they pick up on that. Your staff can sense that you have faith in their abilities or that you sincerely want them to do well. Having that confidence alone will help to improve staff attitudes as well as their performance. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Gratitude: When your outlook is negative you tend to focus your attention on what is wrong with everything . As you become more positive you start to see the good in people, in life, in yourself. You start to voice your gratitude and that alone will help improve another's attitude. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Perspective: This is a logical progression from your increasing feelings of gratitude. You appreciate the many positives in your life and recognize that they far outweigh any problems or temporary inconveniences such as an employee calling in sick. You don't let it tear you down or upset you because you realize it actually is a very minute problem when you focus on the big picture. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Approachability: It is much easier to approach a person with a smile on their face than one who has a frown. A smile is a sign of warmth and optimism where a frown just says &quot;stay away from me I am not in a very good mood.&quot; Your staff needs to know that you are always approachable and willing to listen. You may have to schedule a more convenient time but you are always willing to listen. Be there for your staff, mentally and physically. This can become draining if you do not have a strong positive attitude. <br>
              <img src="../../../images/key.gif" width="34" height="35">Spiritual growth: When you're filled with positive thoughts and feelings, you begin to appreciate yourself and others more. You begin to sense that there's a purpose behind everything and that you are a part of a bigger plan. You also trust your intuition and realize that you're receiving guidance on your journey. </p>
          <p align="left" class="style3">I think you would agree that this is a pretty impressive list of characteristics. And the way to access all of them is to build a more positive attitude. Never forget, however that your attitude is a choice you make everyday. The qulaity of your life and the impact you make in the world depends on that choice. Your Attitude is Everything!!!! </p>
