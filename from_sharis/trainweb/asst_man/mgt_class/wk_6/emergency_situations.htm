      <p>That is why the Emergency Situation Binder was created. Every possible situation is included in this binder. We ask managers to make sure that if they should experience a crisis situation that is not included to please let us know how they resolved the situation. We in turn will update the binder with a new Emergency Situation Sheet. This way the next manager to experience the same situation can look up the procedures in the binder. </p></td>
