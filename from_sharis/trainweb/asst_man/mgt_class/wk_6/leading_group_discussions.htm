      <td colspan="2"><ul>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Emanate goodwill and open-mindedness. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Have challenging questions ready that will focus attention on the information to be discussed and will stimulate interest and response. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Don't let a few people dominate the discussion. Make every effort to draw others into it. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Never interrupt, embarrass or rebuke a group member. Don't tell a group member (s)he is wrong; rather ask others in the group to comment on the suggestion or opinion. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Avoid letting the discussion slip into a question and answer session or a variation on a lecture. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Be patient with employees who fail to grasp matters that seem obvious to you. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Learn to paraphrase and summarize to ensure that you understand an employee's statement and to save time. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">If the discussion begins to go off on a tangent, summarize what has been said and ask a leading question to get it back on the subject. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Use a blackboard or flip chart to record significant points. (Remember that the purpose of these aids is to recall ideas, so abbreviate and use as few words as possible.) </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">If group members' responses are vague, ask for specific examples. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">If unrelated problems arise, table them until the scheduled issues have been completed. (If they are personal or inappropriate for group discussion, politely inform the employee that the matter will be discussed at another time.) </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">When overlapping ideas or suggestions are presented, note both of them despite similarities. Duplication and repetition don't cause any harm and can sometimes prove useful. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Learn to tolerate silence. You may be able to legitimatize it by telling the group that an immediate response to a difficult question or new policy is not required. Remember that silence seems to last longer than it really does. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Do not tolerate side conversations between two group members. Tactfully attempt to include those persons in the larger discussion, perhaps by calling on one individual by name. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">To avoid having two or three persons speaking at one time, it is wise to establish a rule that group members raise a hand and be acknowledged before speaking. If the group size is less than seven or eight in number, this may be too formal, however. Use your judgment. Try to be alert to two or three hands up at the same time. Call on them one at a time, but don't forget any of them. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Strive constantly for group understanding, acceptance and consensus in an effort to build teamwork. When the group becomes divided on a minor issue or suggestion, don't waste time trying to reconcile it. Chart it, place a question mark by it and proceed to the next issue or response. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Keep one eye on your watch and the other on your timetable. Be sure to stay on schedule. Begin on time, complete the discussion, and end on time. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Be certain that the group is committed to doing something before the meeting is adjourned. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Thank group members for their help. Summarize the discussion to stress important points, help organize ideas and enable the group members to see how much they have accomplished. This also allows group members to recognize the quality of their ideas and their productiveness. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Assure members that a copy of the proceedings of the meeting, including charts and graphs, will be received by each of them within three days. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left">Assure them that you will follow up on the agreed plan of action and will give them a progress report at the next meeting. </div>
        </li>
