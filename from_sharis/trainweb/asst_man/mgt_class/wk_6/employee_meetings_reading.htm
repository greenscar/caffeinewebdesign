Everywhere from making the wrong decisions about the goals and problems to making the wrong decisions about the capabilities of the employees to telling the employees the information they need. The most common problems in management occur at the &quot;people&quot;level. Those problems are the most complex and difficult to solve. The wise manager recognizes these facts and plans and conducts meetings not only to share working experiences and common goals, aims and purposes but, more importantly, to communicate the objectives, policies, standards and procedures of the restaurant, as well as the responsibilities of and expectations from staff. In this reading assignment we will be learning how to conduct effective meetings, other ways to communicate, how to handle difficult situations and how to resolve meeting conflict. <br>

Consider the cost of a meeting: your time to prepare, the wages and benefits for all employees, food and beverage served at the meeting, and finally, disruption to the store. Meetings do have a considerable cost - they also provide  great benefits. Before scheduling a meeting, perhaps a manager should consider other means of communication.<br>

    <td><p class="style6">A meeting will not always be necessary. It really depends upon the type of information you need to convey and what you want to accomplish. A well conducted meeting not only conveys information but there are some &quot;soft&quot; benefits as well. Consider the following.</p>
      <p class="style6"><span class="style21"><u>Improve Communication and Foster Change</u></span> <span class="style21">: </span><span class="style5">It is natural for people to resist change. People often become suspicious and uneasy over changes that haven't been explained. Introducing new procedures requires employees to change and learn something new. Meetings which discuss change, therefore, can be a way of indicating management's sincere and considerate understanding of each individual's feelings. This attitude reduces the tendencies of people to resist change and results in better cooperation. Another way in which meetings can improve communications between management and employees is in promoting unity of understanding. Attendees at the meeting hear the same thing at the same time, said the same way. All employees have an opportunity to hear questions presented and hears the answers.</span></p>      
      <p class="style5"><u><strong>Save Time</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Group meetings conserve the manager's time. It takes only a fraction of the time to give or get information from a group of 15 than would be required if each received the information individually. Again, the advantage of a far greater degree of uniformity of understanding is also achieved.</p>
      <p class="style5"><u><strong>Training</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Although training is basically a day-to-day, continuing responsibility of management, use of meetings to accomplish training goals is effective. Role plays, visual aids, demonstrations and group discussions are all training techniques which can be easily adapted to a meeting format.</p>
      <p class="style5"><u><strong>Management of the Mobile</strong></u><strong>:</strong> The very nature of foodservice causes employees to be constantly active, thereby limiting the opportunity for supervision. In much the same way that a sales manager relies on monthly sales meetings to check on the productivity and the problems of the sales personnel, the foodservice manager should rely on staff meetings.</p>
      <p class="style5"><u><strong>Esprit de Corps</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Keep in mind that the best employee, the most productive employee is the one who identifies themselves with the restaurant, feels that they are &quot;in the know,&quot; feels a sense of belonging and acceptance, and is a part of the entire operation. Managers can increase the number of productive employees through carefully planned, skillfully led meetings. <u>Group</u> enthusiasm is a<u> group process.</u></p>

Maybe meetings at your store are painful because they turn into &quot;gripe sessions&quot; pitting one shift against another. Good news! Planning can eliminate most, if not all of these problems.

          <ul>
            <li>Task - the task is the reason the meeting is being held - improve suggestive selling, present the new menu, improve food cost, decrease shortages, and review the new side work system are a few examples. You may have several for your meeting. The task should always begin with a verb: (to decide, to solve, to view, to hear, to inform, to review.) </li>
            <li>Desired Outcome - the desired outcome describes the expected results of the meeting. For example, &quot;I am expected to increase my beverages sales by 1%. I can do this by offering 3 specific beverage choices and offering beverages throughout the meal. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Usually, the task(s) of the meeting is easy to determine - the real benefit of the meeting comes by determining and then presenting the desired outcomes. How do you want behaviors to change? What results do you want to see? How do the employees accomplish this? All questions you need to answer to gain the full effectivness for the money that you've invested in a meeting. </p>
      </blockquote>      <ol>
        <li><u><span class="style18">Decide on Methods</span></u><span class="style18">:</span> You as the manager most likely know the solutions to create the desired outcome. However, realizing that the involvement of the staff is essential to creating teamwork you may decide that group discussions will work for some portions of the meeting. Other portions may require demonstrations(new items or procedures), lecture (policy) and so on. Once you have a list of topics, you should decide how you are going to convey the information. The best meetings use several techniques.</li>
        <li><u><span class="style18">Outline the Meeting</span></u><span class="style18"> (Agenda):</span> Outlines serve many purposes, including the most important one of being prepared. A written outline also allows a manager to keep the goals of the meeting constantly in mind, especially if the discussion begins to go off on a tangent.Your outline does not need to be lengthy or detailed but should include a listing of the major points you intend to discuss and the sequence and method in which you intend to present your materials. <br>

    <td><p><u><span class="style18">Managing Conflict</span></u><span class="style18">:</span> Interpersonal conflict in meetings is not necessarily bad. In fact, it can be healthy when handled properly. Therefore, the question is not how to eliminate conflict but how to capitalize on its constructive aspects. A moderate level of conflict can have these constructive consequences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased motivation and energy to do a task</li>
        <li>Increased innovative thinking trough a greater diversity of viewpoints</li>
        <li>Increased understanding of a position on an issue by forcing the advocate of that position to articulate and support it with facts.</li>
        <li>Increase understanding of opposing positions on an issue by being forced to listen and then working to integrate diverse positions.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>When everyone is doing his or her best, conflict is natural. What is best for one group (servers) won't necessarily be the best for other (cooks). Therefore, conflict management is a necessary skill for conducting effective meetings.</p>
    <p>Conflict develops when participants become assertive while presenting their point of view. Conflict results from four classic conditions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lack of communication</li>
      <li>Different perceptions</li>
      <li>Different values </li>
      <li>Different preferred outcomes</li>
      </ol>
    <p>We want to consider two factors when attempting to manage conflict. Those are the levels of assertiveness and cooperation.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Assertiveness: People tend to be more assertive when an issue is important to them, they are confident in their knowledge, or sense that the discussion is going contrary to their preferred course. </p>
      <p>Cooperation: People tend to be more cooperative when they respect the opposition, when they value their relationship with the opposition, and when they recognize the opposition is needed to help implement a satisfactory outcome.</p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>Look at the following quadrants and see how the levels of assertiveness and cooperation operate in a conflict situation. </p>

    <td colspan="3"><p>Once conflict arises, it must be dealt with - as mentioned above, this can be  positive and helpful if handled correctly. Following are four general ways that conflict can be handled.</p>
    <p><span class="style18">Confrontation:</span> Those involved exchange information about a situation and express their feelings openly. Problem solving becomes a matter of working through differences. Consensus or agreement is the desired outcome - a convincing of the other side. Confrontation can be very difficult when dealing with groups of High Assertiveness and Low Cooperation.</p>
    <p><span class="style18">Compromise:</span> Instead of working through confrontation, another approach is to split differences and reach a compromise satisfactory to the various parties. This should only be used with issues that do not affect operations, for example, a group of servers may wish to compromise on how sidework is organized. However a manager must never allow compromise on a set policy or standard, a group of cooks could not decide that they would like to make a menu item differently.</p>
    <p><span class="style18">Smoothing:</span> Instead of confronting issues it is possible to smooth them over. This is a technique you might use if confrontation is getting out of hand. You might say something like &quot;We're not making progress here, perhaps the involved parties will work this out later.&quot; Unfortunately, when problems are smoothed over, they usually are not solved. They often become worse. This technique would be appropriate to end a heated confrontation in a group setting to solve it later with those affected.</p>
    <p><span class="style18">Use of Power:</span> At times a manager must simply make a decision and state it frankly. At times this can be unpopular, but typically, the manager has  more of a big-picture view and the company is trusting in them to follow company policy, standards and culture. A unilateral decision made by the manager can end conflict and is often times welcome.</p>
    <p>Research indicates that confrontation is the best approach to conflict resolution. Properly done, it preserves the best interests of those involved. In spite of widely different positions, people can engage in problem solving under conditions of conflict if they are willing to generate valid reasons for their differences.</p>
    <p><u><span class="style22"><strong>Handling Confrontation</strong></span></u><span class="style22">:</span> The following ideas should help you handle confrontations in a positive way.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarify Objectives - Clarifying and reaching agreement on objectives is an important first step.</li>
      <li>Strive for Understanding - As a meeting leader, you may want to stop the action and make sure each party in a confrontation can state the opposing party's position and supporting reasons.</li>
      <li>Focus on the Rational - Keep attention focused on rational considerations - facts, supporting reasons, potential problems if a certain course of action is followed. </li>
      <li>Generate Alternatives - This is where group members not at either extreme can become a resource to generate some reasonable alternatives.</li>
      <li>Table the Issue - Tabling can be an effective way to deal with conflict when you feel a party needs time to consider the arguments that have been presented.</li>
      <li>Use Humor - If you are good with humor it can be used to reduce the emotional tenseness of confrontation. It can serve as a release and clear the way for more rational problem-solving. <br>

    <td><p><strong>Follow Up After Meeting = Leadership</strong></p>
    <p>It is important that you follow up the meeting by doing what it was you agreed to do. This is another way to increase employee cooperation and improve employee-manager relations. It lets employee know that you are not just a &quot;talker&quot;.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You could summarize the meeting and post notes</li>
      <li>Report on progress until goals are met.</li>
      <li>Give recognition to the group and individuals.</li>
      <li>Get answers to questions asked.</li>

    <p><u><strong>Summary:</strong></u> When looking at this list, one may say, &quot;This is a lot of work, why have a meeting at all!&quot; Did you notice that each step was followed by <strong>= Leadership</strong>? That is why the effort <u><em>is</em></u> worth it. As managers you have a certain amount of authority because you are &quot;the boss&quot;. The difference though, between a &quot;boss&quot; and a &quot;leader&quot; is the willing respect that the employees give the leader. Managers who involve their employees in the running of the restaurant, who keep them informed and challenged by having good meetings are truly leaders who have earned their employee's respect and loyalty. Once you get used to the  tasks of putting a meeting together it becomes routine and less effort is required, but the benefits of motivated, informed and dedicated employees is priceless. </p></td>
