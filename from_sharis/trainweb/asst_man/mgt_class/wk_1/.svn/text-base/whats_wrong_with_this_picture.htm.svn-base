Closing checklist not complete.\r\rEmployee notes:\r\r1. Third lateness should be a written warning in file or suspend or term, are we setting a tolerance for poor attendance?\r2. The very, very cute hostess comment is inappropriate.\r3. What follow up has been done, very little is noted.\r4. Good comments about Sarah\'s performance.\r\rCustomer comments and concerns: \r\r1. Swing shift comment is flippant and doesn\'t help us solve any problems.\r2. Good day shift comments and follow-up.\r\rEquipment and building:\r\r1.
