      <p class="style1">The experienced manager who has developed the “Working The Floor Sense” thinks of all these things because they know that one minor event can have an impact on so many functions and people. &nbsp; The smell of burnt toast, the look on a server's face or the tone of a customer's voice sets them into action. &nbsp; So, how does a manager develop this “Sixth Sense?” &nbsp; Well, it begins with focusing on two skills: anticipation and awareness. </p>
      <p class="style1"><u>Anticipation</u>: &nbsp; The skill of being able to anticipate comes from experience. &nbsp; Intuitive people file away all of their experiences and call upon those when they sense a problem. &nbsp; This experience comes partly form knowing how to perform all jobs in the restaurant. &nbsp; For example, when a manager sees that the door is getting busy, they know (because they have waited tables) that they need to be on the floor controlling the seating, making sure that tables are rotated evenly, and that no single server gets too many tables in a row. &nbsp; This is one reason that Shari's begins all management training by learning each job code function. </p>
    <p class="style1"><u>Awareness</u>: &nbsp; Awareness of not only what you can see, but also what you can smell, taste, feel and hear. &nbsp; A manager with a developed sense of awareness picks up on potential and real problems by just walking around in the normal course of their duties. These managers are able to advert and minimize situations because of their alertness.</p>
    <p class="style1"><span class="style1">In this reading assignment we are going to be looking at different ways that we can develop our awareness and anticipation skills. &nbsp; We will also be discussing ways that we can work with our employees to ensure that shifts run smooth for them and that our guests receive an enhanced dining experience. </span></p>

      <p class="style1"> We have many tools at our disposal. &nbsp; We've spent a lot of time this week learning to use systems that help us prevent emergencies and thus distractions. &nbsp; The manager who consistently uses pre-shift logs, a time management system, and pre shift-meetings will avoid many of the pitfalls that face other managers who fail to plan. &nbsp; This leaves more of their attention free to develop the skills of awareness and anticipation that are the true mark of a manager who runs the floor well. &nbsp; Running the floor well is the base for so many other tasks; managers who run a good floor also have good food cost, better labor and more profit. &nbsp; The manager who runs the floor well earns the trust, respect and cooperation of their employees. &nbsp; Isn't this what we should all strive to be? </p>      </td>
