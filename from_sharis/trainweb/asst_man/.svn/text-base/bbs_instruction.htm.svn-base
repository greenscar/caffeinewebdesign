    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_login.JPG" width="397" height="165" border="1"></p>
    <p align="left"> You may change your password if you wish by selecting “Profile” after you have logged in. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_profile.JPG" width="576" height="60" border="1"></p>
    <p align="left"> To change your password, type in your current password (the one we gave you), then type in your new password twice. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_change_password.JPG" width="576" height="230" border="1"></p>
    <p align="left">Do not change any of the standard settings. You may select an Avatar (a cartoon character that identifies your postings) if you like. To select an Avatar, go to the bottom of the screen and select “Show Gallery”. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_show_avatar.JPG" width="575" height="78" border="1"></p>
    <p align="left"> Select the desired character, scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on “select avatar”, next click on “submit” and your avatar is selected. You can change or de-select your Avatar at any time by following the same procedures. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_select_avatar.JPG" width="353" height="129" border="1"></p>
    <p><u>Posting to the Bulletin Board</u>: </p>
    <p>When you log into the bulletin board you will see the Forum Index for your class. </p>
    <p>Click on the correct week or topic. Also, look for yellow folders by the topics; this indicates that there is a new posting that you have not read. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_forum1.JPG" width="316" height="281"></p>    
    <p>Each day you should look for Announcements or Sticky Notes - these will appear at the top of the list and are messages to students that are posted by your instructor. After checking for Announcements or Sticky Notes, click the topic or day that was listed in the assignment. Again, look for yellow folders next to the questions, these indicate new postings within the topic that you haven't read yet. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_topics1.JPG" width="324" height="224"></p>    
    <p> The question you are to answer will appear. To post your answer, click on the “post answer” button and type in your answer. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_answer.JPG" width="576" height="165" border="1"></p>
    <p align="left">Type a title in the subject line and then type your answer in the box. You can select font type, color and some formatting if you wish. When you have finished typing, click on submit and your answer will post to the board. You will be able to read your response along with everyone else's. After posting, you also have the option to edit your response. </p>    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_answer2.JPG" width="512" height="333" border="1"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    
    <p><u>Responding To Each Other</u>: </p>
    <p>As part of classes you will always be required to read other student's postings. At times you will also be required to make comments about their answers. To do this, click on the “post reply button within their window. Type in your response and click on submit. If you are answering someone's comment on your comment, use the same procedure. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_responses.JPG" width="576" height="319" border="1"></p>
    <p align="left">The  example below shows the original response and an instructor's comment and then another response from the student. This is a great example of how to use the bulletin board. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/orientation/bb_responses2.JPG" width="575" height="184" border="1"></p>    <p>The purpose of the bulletin board is to simulate a class discussion. You should activity participate in all discussions. For the most part, bulletin board questions are graded for content and frequency. Following are the standard rules for answering bulletin board questions. </p>    
    <ol>
      <li>To receive points you must post a thoughtful answer. An answer such as “I agree with the reading assignment”, “I don't know” or copying another student's answer will not get you any points. You hae th epossibility of receiving up to 10 points for answering the question. You will receive 5 more points for responding to your fellow students when assigned.</li>
      <li>Bulletin board assignments span several days. For example, on Monday you answer a bulletin board question. On Tuesday, you will want to look at Monday's question to read your instructor's comments. If Tuesday's assignment is to respond to your fellow students, you will need to go back to Monday and make those comments. If Wednesday's assignment is for you to respond to comments made by your fellow students, you will need to go back to Monday again and reply. Look for a yellow folder beside topics – this indicates that there are new posting that you haven't read. </li>
      <li>No profane and inappropriate language is to be used on the bulletin board. </li>
      <li>When you make comments or respond to other students, be respectful and polite. Treat each other as you would like to be treated. When you respond to someone you may: </li>
    </ol>    
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; Ask them a question to clarify, phrase it politely<br>
        &#149;&nbsp; Agree with them, but you must state your reason for doing so. Agreeing with a “ditto” or “I agree” will not get you any points.<br>
        &#149;&nbsp; Disagree respectfully and state your reason.<br>
        &#149;&nbsp; Expand upon or add to a point that they have made<br>
    </p>
