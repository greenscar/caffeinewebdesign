        This way when people naturally forget something they will be performing 
        closer to the expected standard. As an added bonus, the expected standard 
        of performance will rise as people forget less!</font></p>

      <p><font color="#996666">I began working for Shari's as a server in Bend 
        in 1982, never intending for Shari's to be my career. I became an assistant 
        manager in Newberg and for 6 years I was a general manager of various 
        stores in the Seattle area. In 1988 I was chosen to create the training 
        department. In 1992 I was promoted to the position of Vice President.</font></p>

        I love my job because of its diversity. My tasks vary from day to day, 
        teaching management and CEO classes, Guest Appreciation Weekends, producing 
        videos, store visits and my all time favorite - opening new stores.</p>
      <p><b><i><font color="#003300">What is your favorite training tip?</font> 
        </i></b>WALK YOUR TALK! Be everything you expect and more. Remember that 
        each trainee is different and strive to learn something new from each 
        one. Most of all - have fun!</p>
      <p><b><i><font color="#003300">What are your favorite interests and hobbies

      <p>I began working for Shari's as a server in 1990 at the then brand new 
        Milwaukie location. I became an in-store trainer 30 days later, and a 
        supervisor 2 months after that. I helped open my first Shari's (Clackamas) 
        in 1991. By 1993 I was teaching CEO seminars. I joined the Training Department 
        in 1995 and haven't had a dull moment since, I love it!</p>

      <p><b><i><font color="#003300">What is your favorite training tip?</font></i></b> When training a new manager, play the good host/bad host game with them. The trainee and the GM come in the door pretending to be guests. First the staff ignores you: time how long it takes for the trainee to feel they are not welcome. Then return and have the good host seat you properly. Discuss the feeling of each experience with the trainee. It really makes an impact.</p>
