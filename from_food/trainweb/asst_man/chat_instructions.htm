      <td colspan="2"><p>Shari's Corporate University Chat Room function is to be used as an interactive learning tool. Chat Room participation is used in many online assignments to share ideas, learn from guest presenters and enhance your learning experience by simulating a live classroom environment. Following are the basic codes of conduct and instructions for using the chat Room.</p>
        <p align="center">Code of Conduct </p>
        <p><u>Respect</u> : Please show respect for one another at all times. You may disagree with a statement, but you must do so politely. No profanity or degrading remarks (such as, that idea is stupid) are allowed. Always use good common sense and don't speak to anyone in a manner that you wouldn't like to be spoken to. </p>
        <p><u>Typing</u> : Not everyone is a fast and accurate typist, and that is not the point of the chat room. Be thoughtful in your comments, but we will not be concerned with spelling, grammar or punctuation. The idea is to keep the conversation going. However, not everyone understands chat room. lingo, please type out all of your comments fully, don't use internet talk such as lol (laugh out loud). </p>
        <p><u>Participate</u> : Participate in the conversation; the sharing of ideas is the point of the assignment. There is no such thing as a dumb idea or question. Many chat room. assignments are graded for points. On the other hand, don't hog the conversation either. </p>
        <p><u>Be on Time</u> : Unlike the bulletin board the chat room. assignments are synchronized, which means that everyone is online at the same time. Be courteous to your instructor and fellow students by joining the chat room. at the assigned time. </p></td>
