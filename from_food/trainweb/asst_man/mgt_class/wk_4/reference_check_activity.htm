    <td colspan="2"><p>How a perspective employee has performed in the past is the best indication of how they will perform in the future. This, therefore makes the reference check one of the most important steps in the interview process. Some managers think that it is impossible to get a reference check in this day and age. Former employers are reluctant to give out information (especially negative information) that could get them in trouble later. But, as with many requests, it's all about how you ask. In this activity assignment we are going to be checking the references of three employees. Before you begin this assignment you need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read the Reference Checking chapter of your Interviewing Manual - don't whine, it's two pages!</li>
        <li>Select three of your current applications for which you could check references. You will be actually calling their references so make sure that their references are listed and locatable (look up phone numbers if needed).</li>
        <li>Follow the three script scenarios below - be prepared to think on your feet, the conversation may not go as planned. Feel free to break from the script if that is where the conversation is leading you - the point of the activity is to try different techniques</li>
        <li>Take notes, you will be answering a bulletin board question about your experience.<br>
        </li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p><u>Scenario One</u>: Standard Format</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call a prospective reference and say &quot;I'm (your name) from Shari's and I'm checking the references of (applicant). I was wondering if you could answer a few questions for me? </li>
        <li>If they are reluctant to answer questions state &quot;I'm holding their application where they have signed a release authorizing former employers to provide information.</li>
        <li>Ask the following questions:</li>
      </ul>      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Did the employee work well with others?<br>
          Did the employee meet or exceed job requirements?<br>
          Was the employee punctual and attendance acceptable?<br>
          What were the employee's strengths and weaknesses?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>This reference should be for an applicant that you have actually interviewed. </li>
        <li>Call a perspective reference and say &quot;My name is (your name) and I just spoke to (applicant's name). They suggested that I call you to verify our conversation.</li>
        <li>If they ask where you're from, politely tell them, also if needed, state that you have a written release. </li>
        <li>Ask the same questions as above, only use the format of repeating the applicant's information and use their name often, for example:</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Sandra said that while working at (location) she really enjoyed her coworkers - do you agree with that? Continue to ask the questions listed above, using the phrase &quot;Sandra said - or Sandra told me&quot;. By reapeating information that Sandra said, you are making it easy for them to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. </p>

      <li>How long have you known (applicant)?</li>
      <li>Have you ever worked with (applicant) before? </li>
