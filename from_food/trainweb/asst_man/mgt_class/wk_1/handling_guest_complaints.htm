      <p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The resolution of most complaints will require some type of compensation to the guest. &nbsp; Many managers balk at this, fearing that their food cost will be high, that they might be taken advantage of or that the error was really the guest's fault (such as, they didn't order correctly or understand the parameters of a coupon). &nbsp; These are legitimate concerns and at times we may well be taken advantage of; there is rarely a way to know for certain. &nbsp; Nevertheless, remember our goal: to win the customer back!  If that means over compensating to satisfy a guest, compensating a guest who doesn't deserve it or accepting blame when it really wasn't our fault, it doesn't matter because if we keep the guest, we win! &nbsp; Following are a list of compensation solutions that you can offer the guest. &nbsp; The rule of thumb is to make the punishment fit the crime. &nbsp; Offer what you think is reasonable and adjust your resolution based upon the reaction of the guest. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Sincere apology and commitment to fix the problem – Can work for minor complaints </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Accept blame and provide extra attention – Use for timing error, a missed meal, out of order on the wait list and so on, you may need to couple this with a meal comp as well. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Re-cook or fix the food – Remember, the guest is still hungry, fix the problem as quickly as you can. &nbsp; Don't leave anything to chance; personally supervise the re-cooking to ensure that everything is done correctly. &nbsp; Don't skimp, remake the whole plate with fresh products and personally deliver the item to the guest. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Offer to get them something else – this helps when the guest makes a mistake ordering or is disappointed in what they ordered. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Offer free beverages, desserts or appetizers – This can go a long way to soothe a guest who has waited too long. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Comp a portion of the meal or the entire meal if necessary – try to read your guests and offer what will be the most satisfying for them. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Take over the service – sometimes that may be necessary in the event of rude or inattentive service and you may have to couple this with comps as well (server forgot an item). </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Offer beverage coupons or BMGC (Be My Guest Checks) – this is a great way to entice the guest to come back, you may need to comp something on the current meal as well. </p>
    <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Honor a coupon – At times the limitations on our coupons can be confusing, if the guest presents a coupon that is not valid, it is usually best to accept it anyway – we've gone to all the trouble to get the guest in, to disappoint or anger them just doesn't seem productive. </p></td>

      <p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Shari's policy that the manager on duty personally handles all complaints. &nbsp; Do not delegate this task to a server or assume that the complaint is so minor that it doesn't require your attention. &nbsp; Also, you must encourage your employees to inform you of all complaints. &nbsp; At times, employees are reluctant to let you know about a problem for fear that they will be seen as incompetent or are unsure of how you will react. &nbsp; A manager who handles complaints well earns the respect of his employees. &nbsp; Try the following: </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Treat complaints as learning opportunities – use them to better service, food quality and guest relations. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; When you question employees about the specifics of a complaint, make sure that you are out of ear-shot of the guests, hearing your discussion often adds to their frustration or provokes other guests who have no complaint. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; If a complaint requires more training or discipline of an employee do so off the floor and not in front of other employees or the guest. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Satisfy the guest without angering them further; no server wants to go to a table that you have made madder. </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Stay calm and watch your body language, your employees and guests can read you like a book. </p>
    <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Communicate with the server or cook, letting them know what you are doing so that they can follow through. </p>
    <p class="style1"><strong><u>Steps for Resolving a Complaint</u> </strong>: </p>
    <p class="style1"> Let's be realistic, nobody likes confrontation. &nbsp; Most of us would rather have a root canal than handle a guest complaint. &nbsp; On the other hand, handling complaints can be a rewarding experience when you win over a guest and gain the trust and respect of your employees. &nbsp; When dealing with a complaining guest, follow these simple steps: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="style1"><strong>Listen </strong>: &nbsp; When listening to the guest make sure you concentrate and give them your full attention rather than planning your response. &nbsp; Here are a few Do's and Don'ts to use when listening. </p>

        <p class="style1"><strong>Show Empathy </strong>: &nbsp; To empathize successfully, it's necessary to be a good listener. &nbsp; It is important to concentrate on what your customers are saying by blocking out distractions. &nbsp; Show them that you are really listening by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and saying, “I see,” “I understand how you must feel,” or “I can see why you are upset.” &nbsp; This will let your customer know that you're concerned and that you care. &nbsp; The more they talk the more their anger will dissipate and the more information you will get about the problem. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>Ask Questions if Needed </strong>: &nbsp; The guest may tell you all you need to know, but in some instances, a few questions might be necessary. &nbsp; When asking questions, use open-ended questions, questions that begin with who, what, when, why, where and how. &nbsp; These types of questions will not put your customer on the defensive and will give you more helpful information. </p>

    <p class="style1">Most customers who complain to you (54%-70%) will do business with you again if you resolve their complaint. &nbsp; If they feel you acted quickly and to their satisfaction, then up to 95% of them will do business with you again, and they probably will refer other people to you. &nbsp; Customer-service superstars are people who can think fast in a crisis, who are motivated by a sincere desire to make amends to the customer, and who'll stop at nothing to win the customer back. &nbsp; They give service above and beyond the call of duty. &nbsp; Read on. </p></td>

      <p align="left" class="style1">Rudy Edghill was the general manager of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Manhattan. &nbsp; One day he got a call from a customer who had picked up an order five minutes before, but discovered when he left the order was wrong. &nbsp; </p>      <p class="style1">Edghill apologized, but then he did something extraordinary. &nbsp; He asked for the customer's address, and then took a cab to deliver the correct order in person to the customer's office. &nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style1">Needless to say, the customer was impressed with Edghill's grand gesture. &nbsp; Several days later he showed his appreciation by referring an acquaintance to Edghill – a person who ordered $1,500 worth of food for a luncheon meeting. &nbsp; Edghill not only won over the customer, but the person referred new business to him! &nbsp; Edghill showed the original customer that he was willing to do something extraordinary to keep his business. </p>
