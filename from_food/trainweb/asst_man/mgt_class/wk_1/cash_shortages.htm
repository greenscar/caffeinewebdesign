          <p class="style2">The next step would be to balance petty cash, never balance petty cash before you have purchased all the change you need. &nbsp; Remember, petty cash is never short – if it comes up short, count again just to be sure, then bring it up to the proper amount using money from the deposit cash of the till you are counting. </p>

Also, check for house charges. &nbsp; Next, check your credit cards: verify that the tip amounts and totals are correct. &nbsp; Remember, if you change tip totals, the adjustment will show up in the next shift. You may also want to count credit card slips, if you have more slips than are listed on your POS report, then you probably have one or more closed to cash. </li>
