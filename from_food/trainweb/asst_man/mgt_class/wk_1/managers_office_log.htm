    <td colspan="2"><p class="style1">One of the biggest challenges we face at Shari's is working in a 24 hour fast-paced environment. &nbsp; This makes communication between shifts difficult at best. &nbsp; The Manager Office Log is a tool that was developed with this in mind. &nbsp; The two main functions of the log are to communicate effectively between shifts and to document what has happened on each shift without using a lot of different files and forms. &nbsp; In this reading assignment we will review each section of the Manager's Office Log discussing what information should be found there, how we should use this information and how we can more effectively use the log. </p>
    <p class="style1"><strong>Writing In The Log Book </strong>: &nbsp; The logbook itself is a form of documentation. &nbsp; As a company, we have used notations on the logbook to defend ourselves in unemployment claims, termination hearings, harassment investigations and employee complaints. &nbsp; It is therefore very important that the language you use and the comments about guests and employees are very professional. &nbsp; Never make flippant comments about employees, such as: she had a blond moment, he is dumber than a bag of hammers or the customer was a real pain in the butt. &nbsp; Basically, don't write anything in the logbook in such a way that you wouldn't want to read on a witness stand. &nbsp; Since the logbook is a form of documentation, only salaried managers should have access to it. &nbsp; When a supervisor is on duty, the logbook is to be locked in the file cabinet and supervisors' only logbook is to be used. </p></td>

        <p>In this section, write a brief summary of your shift. We can certainly look up things such as sales and shortages, but that would take some time, it is much easier if each manager writes a brief summary of their shift and we can also see a trend over a period of time. &nbsp; In this section you would also want to write down anything that is going to carry over or possibly affect the next shift. &nbsp; In our example you notice that there is information about the volume and a cash shortage. </p>

      <li class="style1">
        <p>The “To Do” list is a place where your manager can leave items that you need to complete or where you can leave items that need attention the next day. &nbsp; In this example you can see that the assistant filled a shift for the manager and also added the storeroom and freezer cleaning to his list after reading the manager's notes. </p>
