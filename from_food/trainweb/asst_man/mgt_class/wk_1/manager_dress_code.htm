    <p align="left" class="style1 style5">Remember at all times that you are in charge of a million dollar business. &nbsp; It should be apparent to any guest or employee that you are the person in charge. &nbsp; In this country, 55% of what we believe about one another is based on our interpretation of nonverbal signals. &nbsp; This is communicated visually in two major areas – wardrobe and body language. &nbsp; You can look like a million bucks without spending a lot of money. &nbsp; Here are some tips. </p>      <p align="left" class="style1"><u><span class="style5">Clean Pressed Clothes</span></u><span class="style5"> : &nbsp; Your clothes don't need to be expensive – the most expensive suit can look shabby if it is wrinkled or has food stains on it. &nbsp; Invest in a good quality iron and make sure that your clothes are always clean and pressed. &nbsp; For the guys, it may be worth it to have your shirts professionally laundered – this keeps the cuffs and collars clean and your shirts will last longer. &nbsp; Also, keep your clothes in good repair. &nbsp; Replace buttons and fix tiny frays as needed. &nbsp; Replace clothing when it becomes stained. </span></p>      <p align="left" class="style6"><u>Make Sure That Your Clothes Fit Right</u> : &nbsp; Clothes that are too baggy look sloppy and clothes that are too short or tight look unprofessional. &nbsp; Invest in a full-length mirror and view yourself from all directions. &nbsp; When buying new clothes, make sure that they are comfortable. &nbsp; Do they have pockets? &nbsp; What does it look like when you sit down? &nbsp; Buy clothes that flatter your figure, not just what is popular. &nbsp; Make sure that your skirt length is appropriate, remember, you are bending over to bus tables. </p>      <p align="left" class="style6"><u>Tuck Those Shirts In</u> : &nbsp; Make sure that your shirttail remains tucked in. &nbsp; For the gals, you can really finish up an outfit by tucking in the shirt and adding a belt. &nbsp; Guys, you need a belt as well. </p>      <p align="left" class="style6"><u>Buy Good Basics</u> : &nbsp; Invest in good basic clothing such as dark colored skirts and slacks. &nbsp; You can add different shirts, sweaters, ties and scarves to make your outfits look totally different. &nbsp; When you find a brand or style that fits nice, buy several colors to mix and match. &nbsp; Always do the wrinkle test before you buy something. &nbsp; Grab a bunch of the material and squeeze it – does it wrinkle? &nbsp; For the gals, invest in several vests and jackets. &nbsp; These also can be mixed and matched to make outfits look different. &nbsp; Avoid trendy clothes and outfits that can't be mixed and matched. &nbsp; These go out of style quickly and will add to your clothing expense. </p>          <p align="left" class="style6"><u>Protect Your Clothes</u> : &nbsp; Buy a can of Scotchguard and spray your clothes on a regular basis. &nbsp; This will make stains come out easier and your clothes will last longer. &nbsp; Have the linen company leave you several long butcher coats or have long cook aprons in the office. &nbsp; When you have to go into the kitchen, put on the butcher coat or apron. &nbsp; This will keep your clothes clean during your shift and also keep them from staining. </p>      <p align="left" class="style6"><u>Think About Your Image</u> : &nbsp; If you look like the person in charge, your guests and employees will respect you more. &nbsp; Employees and guests alike want to be able to tell with one glance, who is in charge. &nbsp; A well-dressed manager gives them confidence that everything is going to be all right. &nbsp; You may not always know what you are doing, but a sharply dressed person portrays confidence and trust. </p>      <p align="left" class="style6"><u>Body Language</u>: &nbsp; Carry your head high and walk like you have a purpose. </p>
