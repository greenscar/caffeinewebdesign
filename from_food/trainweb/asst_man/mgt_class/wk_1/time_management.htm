      <span class="style1">We all face the daily dilemma: too much to do and not enough time to do it. &nbsp; Time management concerns how we resolve that dilemma. &nbsp; Time, not activities, is the limiting factor. &nbsp; We must make tough choices about what to do and what not to do.
      </p> 
      </span>      <p align="left" class="style1">Time management is really self-management. &nbsp; Although time is not adaptable, people are. &nbsp; Managing time means adapting ourselves to its passage in some satisfying manner.  It means managing ourselves. &nbsp; If time seems to be out of control, it means that we are out of control. &nbsp; To bring ourselves back under control, we must learn how to make good time management decisions. &nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">At Shari's we use a priority based time management and decision making process. &nbsp; Our three operating priorities help us decide what needs to be done while our three time management principles help us decide when to do it. </p></td>

    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p class="style1">Quite simply – anything that affects the guest is an “Absolute” that needs to be taken care of right away. &nbsp; Things that affect the cleanliness and smooth operation of the restaurant are “Priorities” – these are important and should be the next. &nbsp; Nice To's” typically fall into the “everything else” category – these are projects that enhance the operation of the store, yourself or your staff. &nbsp; Just because the “Nice To's” fall into the “Everything Else” category doesn't mean that they aren't important. &nbsp; These tasks are usually things that are fun and are essential to your restaurant; they just aren't time critical. &nbsp; </p>
    <p class="style1">It is also important to realize that the importance of a task can change. &nbsp; For example, completing employee reviews may begin as a “Nice To” but may become a “Priority” if food cost is high or sidework isn't getting done. &nbsp; Now you receive a few guest complaints on service and reviews become an “Absolute” because it is affecting the guest. </p></td>

On each log, you will find a timeline for the shift. These are time critical items that need to happen prior to or during a shift to ensure that the guest is taken care of. Following these timelines is the beginning step in planning your day. </span></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style6">Check your plan from the previous day and see if there is anything left that needs to be moved to today. Make a list of the items you would like to accomplish and write them on the “To Do List”. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style6">Now review your list and determine if the items are “Absolutes”, “Priorities” and “Nice To's”. Schedule these items on the timeline where you think that it is most likely that you will accomplish them. Remember that during the times in the gray shaded area you should be on the floor. Don't write in anything during these times that would take you away from the floor for a long period of time. Schedule items that can be completed on the floor, even if they are “Priority” and “Nice To” items, this way you will have more time to complete “Absolutes” when you can be off the floor. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style6">Mark items off the list as you complete them and also add new items as they come up. The restaurant can be chaotic at times and things can come up that will affect our plan – for example, an employee may call in sick creating a new “Absolute” that we must take care of immediately. </p>

    <td colspan="2"><p class="style1">This is really the crux of management; learning to lead and motivate your people to achieve. &nbsp; The manager who masters this not only earns the respect of his or her crew but also increases their own productivity as well. &nbsp; This involves setting goals, communication and the delegating and sharing of responsibilities. &nbsp; Here are some tips for increasing productivity through team time management: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp;<span class="style5"> Learn to delegate some tasks to employees working on your shifts. &nbsp; This enhances the job for your employees because it gives them more responsibility and something different to do. &nbsp; Before delegating make sure that you take the time to train properly, follow up and then thank the employee. </span></p>
        <p class="style6">&#149;&nbsp; Show people that you respect them and their time. &nbsp; Look for ways to save time for them. </p>
        <p class="style6">&#149;&nbsp; Discuss goals, priorities and plans during your one-minute meetings with employees – this way they will be working on the same things that you are – and they appreciate the communication. </p>
        <p class="style6">&#149;&nbsp; Don't be in too big a hurry when instructing others. &nbsp; Take time to do it right the first time. </p>
        <p class="style6">&#149;&nbsp; You can waste a lot of time making all of the decisions. &nbsp; Train your staff to help make decisions by asking the right questions. &nbsp; Next time an employee brings you a question such as: “Can we start breaks?” &nbsp; Ask them, “What do you think?” &nbsp; “Is everyone caught up?” “Are all the tables bussed?” &nbsp; “Are the cooks busy?” &nbsp; “Is the restaurant set up in case we get busy?” &nbsp; This way you are training the employee to ask themselves these questions before they come to you next time. &nbsp; In time they will be coming to you saying “I think that we can start break, all of the tables are bussed, everyone's caught up, the cooks only have one ticket and we're all stocked.” &nbsp; Your life just got easier and you've made up time. </p>
