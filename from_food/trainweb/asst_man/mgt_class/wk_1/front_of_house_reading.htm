Besides, the fewer problems that you have during a shift, the more time you have to devote to customer service, employee training and building sales. &nbsp; Now what store couldn't benefit from that! &nbsp; </p>

If the restaurant should become busy and you haven't finished your FOH log at least you have some of the most important things taken care of. Never think because it's busy it's allright not to complete the FOH log. It can make a difference in the way your day goes - &quot;Those who fail to plan, plan to fail&quot;. Don't be that manager! Come back to tasks and delegate others to trained staff. For example: a server could fill in the station assignment section and a cook could fill in the specials and soup section. When they help the store succeed they feel a part of it and you've just increased morale and ownership! </p>
      <p align="left">Once you have completed the FOH checklist it should be kept at the host stand or in the server alley. &nbsp; Servers and hosts will have access and it can be used as a reminder for specials, side work and targeted breaks. &nbsp; </p>      <p align="left">Once again: clearly communicate your expectations to your staff so they have a goal to work toward. &nbsp; No one wants to follow a leader who has no road map. </p></td>
