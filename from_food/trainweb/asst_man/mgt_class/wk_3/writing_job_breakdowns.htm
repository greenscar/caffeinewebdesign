During this step a crucial factor for success  is to  break the job that needs to be taught into small activities, and then identify the key points that are necessary to perform properly. </p>
    <p>Don't make the mistake of thinking that you can teach a job properly without first breaking it down on paper. Research has found that no matter how well a person knows a job, they can't repeat the instructions covering exactly the same things in the same sequence unless they follow some sort of guide. The guide to walk you through a task while training it – is a “JOB BREAKDOWN.” </p>
    <p>The purpose of the breakdown is to provide a guide so that each time you train a particular skill, it will be trained the same way every time. It is like a ruler, it keeps you going in a straight line. These breakdowns are not hairsplitting micro motion studies. They are just simple, common sense analyses of what is really important teach a skill. </p></td>

These steps are usually in the order they should be completed, for example, if we were going to bus a table, first we would gather the things we need, we would then clear the table, and next we would clean the table. </p>      </td>

If presented correctly, key points are what the trainee will recall when they are performing the job and must decide what to to next - when they have to make a choice between doing the job correctly or incorrectly, hopefully they will recall your key point and choose the correct way.

      <p>These “ important steps ” and “ key points ” are the elements that make up a job breakdown. They provide the trainee with the direction we are trying to go and the target we are trying to hit.</p>    </td>

      <p>The making of a job breakdown is a simple task. It involves two parts, the “ principal steps ” or “ important steps ,” and the “ key points ,” as discussed earlier. </p>
      <p>First, list the “ important steps ” involved in completing the task. These are not minute details but just simple, common sense analyses of what is really important to be put across about a job. Think it through completely and list each of these steps of what actually happens when the task is done correctly. </p>
      <p>Then alongside the important steps list the “ key points .” As we discussed earlier, a “key point” is whatever the trick, knack, feel, special timing, bit of special information is, etc. It is important that it is not every conceivable thing that should be watched or that could go wrong. The “ key points ” is perhaps the most important single thing in the on-the-job instruction. An example might be, “When using a knife, cut away from you.” </p>
    <p>After you have listed the important steps and key points, try it out on someone to see if you left anything out, or perhaps have become too detailed. A workable “guide” for you to use is what is created, a job breakdown. Let's take a look as at very simple job breakdown for &quot;Greeting a Guest&quot;<br>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><div align="center">Job Breakdown - Greeting a Guest </div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="309"><div align="center"><u>Steps</u></div></td>
    <td width="318"><div align="center"><u>Key Points </u></div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Step out from behind the host stand and make eye contact</p>
      <p>Greet guests within 10 seconds of their entering the building. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Say, &quot;Welcome to Shari's&quot; or if you know the guest's name you can greet them by name. <br>
      <br>
      Ask for the number in their party and a seating preference if your store has both smoking and non. <br>
      <br>
      Gather  the items needed to seat guests: Discuss menus and children's items.<br>
      <br>
      Discuss the seating capacity of different shaped tables and rotation for the floor plan that you are working.</p>
    <p>Know exactly what table you are going to and that it is clean and bussed. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Start a waiting list if immediate seating is not available - put them on a list even if you think a table is open but you just want to go check. <br>
      <br>
      When you have all items gathered and know where you are going, ask guests to follow you. <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    <td><p><br>
      <br>
      Guests must know that we know  they are there, even if you can't seat them right away, still acknowledge them. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Servers are expected to learn their guests names, building customer relationships is a core value at Shari's. <br>
      <br>
      Always speak in full sentences, &quot;How many in your party tonight&quot; versus &quot;Two?&quot; - This makes you look more professional. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Never seat a guest at a table that isn't clean and set - if the table isn't clean, you will have to ask them to go up front and wait or bus it in front of them - neither looks good to the guest. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      You never want to take a chance that you will be away from the door and another server will come up and seat new guests ahead of the ones you are finding a table for. <br>
      <br>
      Walk at a comfortable pace and check to see that they are following you. Make conversation as you escort them to the table - this makes them feel more welcome. <br>

  <tr>
    <td><p>Now, if everyone of your servers and hosts had been taught to greet guests using the job breakdown above, would their preformance be different? Would it be better, more detailed? Would it be more consistent? Would your job be easier? Would our guests have an imporved dining experience? I hope you have answered &quot;Yes&quot; to several of these questions. That's what job breakdowns are all about.</p>
