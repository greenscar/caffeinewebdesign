While the Safety Orientation is designed to get new employee off to a good start, the Safety Committee's function is to maintain a safe working environment throughout the employee's career with Shari's. Also by contrast, while the Safety Orientation is manager driven, the Safety committee is employee driven. In this reading assignment we will be discussing the formation, function and and follow-up required of the Safety Committee. </p>
      <p class="style1">Let's face it, the Safety Committee is usually a task that is given to the new assistant. This doesn't mean that the committee isn't important, quite the opposite. Managing the safety committee requires a lot of effort, organization and some creativity to keep the committee interested and active. Some stores look upon the committee as a necessary evil, other look at the Safety Committee as an opportunity to involve it's employees in the crucial task of helping to provide a safe working environment for all employees and assisting in reducing the high costs of worker's comp. <br>

The committee must be made of 3 management-selected and 3 employee-selected members. The manager in charge of the committee is one of the manager selected members. The manager then selects two other employees to serve on the committee. Typically, we like to ask anyone who has had a reportable accident during the previous term to serve on the committee - however, if the employee declines, we can't make them serve.

    <td colspan="2"><p class="style3 style5"><u>Motivating and Following Up on the Safety Committee</u>:</p>
    <p><span class="style1">One of the most difficult tasks when managing the Safety Committee is keeping it active and motivated. As the manager in charge, there is a lot that you can do.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style1"><strong>Meeting Schedule</strong>: Look at the members of your committee and try to schedule meetings on a day when most of them work - this way fewer employees have to come in on their day off. Also, give plenty of advance notice about the meeting so employees can plan. At your first meeting, you may consider having a set time for the meeting. For example: the first Wednesday of each period. Remember, all time spent at Safety Committee meetings or on functions is time worked and therefore paid. <a href="committee_meeting_agenda.htm" target="_blank">Click here to view a safety committee meeting agend</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="style1"><strong>Be Prepared</strong>: Have the agenda in advance and any copies that you need. You also need to be on time and not destracted by any other duties in the restaurant. Your committee members will only take the Safety Committee as seriously as you do. Remember, meetings should be no longer than one hour.</p>
    <p class="style1"><strong>Follow-up and be Involved</strong>: By far the greatest criticism of safety committees is that managers don't follow-up on their recommendations. This causes the committee members to feel that the managers only have the committee because they have to. This is a waste of everybody's time and makes committee members feel used. Follow up on committee suggestions - even if the answer is &quot;no&quot;, let them know why. Another opportunity to become involved is each week when committee members are completing their inspections.</p>
    <p class="style1"><strong>Make Meetings Fun</strong>: Give lottery tickets to each member who has completed a safety inspection, give a door prize, have the baker make cookies, serve pizza, anything to make the meeting fun and out of the ordinary. Ask the committee what they would like.</p>
    <p class="style1"><strong>Provide Training</strong>: Don't expect to delegate committee activities without providing training. Use the training outline for conducting inspections and conduct an inspection with each new committee member. Review the first aid kit orders and also provide assistance on completing the monthly training and keeping the bulletin board up to date.</p>    
    <p class="style1">The Safety Committee is important to insure that we maintain a safe environment for our employees and guests. In the long run it can increase the store's profit and improve store moral by having people involved and identifying hazards early. Having a safety committee is a state and federal requirement and a manager can adopt one of two philosophies: one is to meet the minimum requirements with a little effort as possible. The second is to realize that the time and effort must be spent so they might as well make it count for something by being involved and building an active and effective committee. <br>
