High staff turnover means you must recruit, train and orientate new staff all over again. When the adding machine stops “cha-chinging” the total amount to train a new employee is about $3,000.00. That's a lot of wasted profit due to high turnover. Staff turnover also takes a high toll on the morale of those who do stay behind.

The initial induction of employees during the first few days is important. But it is even more important to make sure new employees fit in and feel comfortable over the longer term. This can mean up to six weeks for a crewmember, or up to six months for new members of a management team. &nbsp; For example: </p>
      <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; Managers should sit down every day during the new employee's training and spend at least 10 minutes reviewing the day with the new employee and the trainer. This will establish rapport and trust between you and the trainee. Taking an interest in their daily training will confirm the importance you place on them being able to execute their job to standards. </p>
    <p class="style1">&#149;&nbsp; During the first 3 months of their employment sit down with them once a week and discuss how things are going for them. &nbsp; Are they still enthusiastic about choosing you as their employer? &nbsp; Answer any questions they may have. &nbsp; This shows you care about them and want them to stay with you. </p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><ol class="style5 style6">
      <li><strong>Create comfort and rapport. </strong><br>
    New staff want to feel a sense of acceptance and belonging inside the organization. Accelerate this process by creating abundant opportunities for new staff to interact with their peers, bosses, guests and managers. During the training process introduce them to guests and other employees. <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Introduce the company culture. </strong><br>
    New staff usually want to fit in with accepted norms and values. &quot;How do things really work around here? What importance do people attach to style, dress, presentation? Is punctuality very important? Do meetings start on time? Are long hours the exception or expected?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Understanding company culture only happens over time, through formal presentations (Orientations), informal dialogue and lots of personal experience. What gets said &quot;officially&quot; is compared with what gets said &quot;confidentially&quot; at the break table and after hours. Be sure your established employees are communicating your culture and standards. &nbsp; If the old-timers aren't using a tray while bussing a table the new employee will feel that standards really aren't important if they aren't being followed or enforced. <br>
    <br>
    Extend your positive influence beyond the formal presentations. Create a buddy system with your CEO's to match your most sincere and enthusiastic staff with your incoming employees. <br>
    <br>
    But don't expect your enthusiastic staff to stay that way if their mentor role becomes a burden. Give the mentor relationship real support: allow time in the weekly training schedule for CEO mentor-mentee conversations, include CEO mentor services in annual staff appraisal and show appreciation to the CEO mentors with tokens of recognition, appreciation and respect. <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Show &quot;The Big Picture&quot; </strong><br>
    You must help new staff find quality answers to all of the following questions: <br>
    <br>
&quot;Where has this company been? Where is it today? Where are we heading? Who are our customers? What do they say about us? Who are our major competitors? What is our market position?&quot; <br>
    <br>
&quot;What is our current focus: are we expanding operations, and launching new marketing? What does our new menu look like?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    You can orient new staff to these &quot;Big Picture&quot; issues with a well-designed presentation. With video or multi-media, highlight your history, and present status, your future goals and directions. Share &quot;humble beginnings&quot;. Detail &quot;greatest achievements&quot;. Show excitement for future directions. But be candid about the company, too. Talk openly about difficulties and challenges in the market. All of our competitors serve food; we need to consistently provide exceptional service to keep our guests returning. Keep your &quot;Big Picture&quot; presentation upbeat and lively, and keep it up to date. <br>
    <br>
    In our organization Larry Curtis is often the best authority to share insight on the future of the business. Show the current years' company “roll out” video in orientations as Larry discusses the opportunities and challenges facing us today. </li>
      <li><strong>Explain job responsibilities and rewards. </strong><br>
    Clarify expectations from the very beginning. Ensure new staff are thoroughly versed on their job responsibilities. Demonstrate and thoroughly explain your staff appraisal system. Show new staff a copy of the actual appraisal form and illustrate how good performance will be assessed, measured and rewarded. Use career paths of those who have come before them to illustrate possibilities and potentials in the job. </li>
      <li><strong>Handle administrative matters. </strong><br>
    There will always be paperwork to complete, forms to fill out and detailed procedures to follow. Employment agreements, insurance policies, benefit packages, I-9's, tools and uniform distribution, the list goes on and on. We complete these at the beginning of the orientation to make way for getting to know each other and the company as the orientation progresses. </li>
      <li><strong>Provide reality checks. </strong><br>
    Make sure your orientation is not an ill-guided fantasy of what you wish the company could be. If your program shows only the bright side of the business and the happy side of daily work, don't be surprised when new employees come back shell-shocked after two or three weeks on the job. Take time to be open and candid about the pressures and realities of your company, your team, your customers and your competition. <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Gain full participation. </strong><br>
    Send a handwritten letter of thanks to your new hire's entire family at the home address - with a copy of your company's (or store's) newsletter. </li>
