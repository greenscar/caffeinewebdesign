That is more than the sales for an average shift! What if the discount percentage was at the higher end? 135,000 in sales with a 5% discount = $6750.00. This is why it is so important to make sure you are doing what you can to control and monitor discounts. This is not to say that we do not want you applying a discount or refusing a coupon. It just means that you want to monitor and control discounts as well as how they are being used. </span></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p class="style2">At Shari's we use three types of discounts: promotional, employee benefit and sales deduction. &nbsp; </p>
      <ol class="style2">
        <li>Promotional discounts are discounts that you need to monitor but don't necessarily control such as honored cards, bakery cards and marketing coupons. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Employee benefit discounts are employee meal discounts you both monitor and control. These discounts are provided as a benefit to the employee. The manager uses his or her discretion in applying employee discounts.<br> 
        </li>
        <li>Sales deduction discounts are Comps that are provided to insure that every food item is accounted for. They allow us to not charge the guest as an apology for a food or service error while still accounting for the food used. Comps are discounts that we both monitor and control. &nbsp; The way we monitor comps is to personally handle each guest complaint where a comp in involved and ensure that we've done enough to retain the guest. &nbsp; Not handling the situation in such a way that the guest will return is a waste of a comp. &nbsp; If the guest is happy with the resolution and will return, that is a comp well spent. &nbsp; The way we control comps is to follow-up with our employees to ensure that the situation, either food or service, doesn't happen again. &nbsp; During week one of class you learned about working the floor as well as guest complaints. You learned to use the front of house &amp; back of house log to set up your shift and communicate with your staff. All this information is provided to help prevent problems from occurring. Remember to use your 6 th sense and you will eliminate the need to comp due to an unhappy guest. Your goal when running your shift is to keep comps at a minimum. Unfortunately there will be times when something will go wrong. This portion of your reading assignment will help you understand the different discounts available and when to use which comp. </li>

For example, if a server entered the wrong item into the computer but caught it before it was prepared, the server would have the manager void the wrong item and enter the correct item. &nbsp;&nbsp; Another example would be when a guest tells you at the register they didn't receive an item on their ticket, such as a milk. &nbsp; No food was used, so no discount is applied; the item is voided. &nbsp; In the forgotten milk example, there is a service issue and the manager should speak to the server about being more careful in checking the meal when it is delivered. </td>

This includes mistakes by cooks, servers and suppliers. We need to compensate the guest for receiving an item that did not meet our standards or the guests. &nbsp; In this next section we will be discussing the different types of comps and when they should be applied. &nbsp; You might be asking yourself “A comp is a comp, why does the type matter, we're just taking money off the ticket?” &nbsp; The reason that we code comps into different categories is to measure performance and identify problems. &nbsp; For example, do we have a server who typically takes too long to get to their tables, do you have a cook who has trouble preparing omelettes? &nbsp; Also realize that the information about comps goes to the individual employee reviews that print at the end of the period. </span></td>

For example, the server does not want to take the omelette out to the guest because it is burnt. This would become waste.

      <p class="style2">The 30% discount is provided to employees after 90 days of employment. Their paycheck will have a 30% discount card attached. &nbsp; Managers must authorize 30% discounts. &nbsp; The key points are ensuring that the employee's signature and employee number are recorded on the guest check and placed in the till. &nbsp; Look for dollar amounts per transaction, the discount is meant for the employee and their immediate family not a huge group of friends. The employee requesting a 30% discount should present their current discount card. &nbsp; The discount is valid seven days a week, but only between the hours of 6:00am and midnight. </p>
      <p class="style2"><u>100% MANAGER MEAL DISCOUNTS</u>: </p>
    <p class="style2">Only manager can process this discount. &nbsp; It is meant for your employee meal while on duty. &nbsp; Be sure to check your store and district policy for off work meals. &nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to watch the dollar amount of this discount group. &nbsp; We want you to eat a nice meal, however, common sense should always be used. &nbsp; Also, remember that you are an example for your employees. <br>
