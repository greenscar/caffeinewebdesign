For example: If for one week your average PPE is 6.52 and guest count is 4400 your sales are $28,688. &nbsp; If you can increase your PPE by just .10 you have – 6.62 X 4400 guests =$29,128 in sales. An increase of $440.00 for one week - $1760.00 for the period! And all you did was increase the PPE. </li>

Put together an action plan for improvement, discuss at your managers meetings and get everyone on the same page. &nbsp; You can accomplish more as a team (synergy) than one working alone. <br>
