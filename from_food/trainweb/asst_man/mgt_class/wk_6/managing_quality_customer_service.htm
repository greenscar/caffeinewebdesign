Many of the guest's expectations are formed before they even visit us. For </p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p align="left">example, a guest may be visiting Shari's for the first time - their expectations are formed by what they have heard, their past experiences in similar restaurants and how they're feeling that day. Other guests may visit us frequently and their expectations are based on their past visits, their reason for visiting us today or possibly their need to be in a comfortable and familiar environment. You would think it's all about food, but actually, a guest's visit typically involves much more. The nature of our 24 hour business creates a large base of clientele that all have different reasons for visiting us and, this changes from day to day and even during various times of the day. Let's consider the following Characteristics of Service and see how they might affect our guest.</p>
        <p align="left">1. <span class="style3"><u>People Versus Things Orientation</u></span>: Is the service we provide more people oriented or is it more oriented toward things? </p>        
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li class="style4">Although we are producing a thing (food) a large percent of our service is people oriented for 90% of our guests - while nearly all guests care about the quality of food, it is the rare person who cares only about the food, while almost everyone cares a great deal about the service.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>        
        <p align="left">2. <u>High Tech Versus Low Tech</u>: If technology is involved in the delivery of the service provided, is it state-of-the-art, or are more traditional tools and/or systems used?</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">Although we use some technology at Shari's we are basically users of more traditional tools and systems - in fact, depending too much on our technology and avoiding the human unpredictable side of our business  often disappoints and alienates our guests. </span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">3. <u>Personal Interaction</u>: Personal interaction can be divided into three parts:</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li>Physical: Do the parties involved have to see each other?</li>
            <li>Mental: To what extent does the interaction demand the people involved to think, to analyze, to comprehend?</li>
            <li>Emotional: To what extent does the interaction rely on emotional-based-reactions and or situations? <br>
            </li>
            <li><span class="style4">At Shari's our interactions tend to be very much physical and emotional and to a lesser extent, mental. So, when dealing with the guest our appearance and conduct as well as our ability to &quot;connect&quot; is essential.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">4. <u>Time Involved</u>: How long does the service take? How frequently does it occur?</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">Isn't this the million dollar question. This can be different from guest to guest, however, most guests' expectation is that this is relatively short. How often a guest visits can also impact their perception. Do frequent guests tend to be more demanding or more forgiving?</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">5. <u>Location</u>: does the service take place at the customer's site, your locale, or somewhere else?</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">One's immediate answer would be &quot;It take place here&quot;, but what about to-go. Service doesn't just end because the guest isn't in our building. Is the guest's expectation different for to go orders?</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">6. <u>Complexity</u>: How complex is the service provided? Complexity can be divided into two views. <em>Actual</em>: How complicated are delivery systems and <em>Visual</em>: How much complexity does the customer see? Do service delivery systems appear to be simple when they are really not? </p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">Really, our guests do not see a lot of the behind the scenes work nor do they completely understand how our business works. For example a guest may question, &quot;I can buy a pound of coffee for $4.50 at Albertson's, why does one cup cost so much&quot;? At times we can be our own worst enemy - we make the business of producing and serving food look easy in the guest's view, when in reality, it is very complex for us.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">7. <u>Accommodation</u>: How flexible and adaptable are the service systems? To what extent can they be adjusted to meet unique or different customer needs or requests?</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">In some areas we can be very flexible in adapting the menu for both product and cooking procedure. Accommodating the guests is part of our culture, so they have come to expect it from us. It also seems to be a trend in the restaurant industry to ask for what you want. </span> </li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">8. <u>Numbers Served Per Transaction</u>: How many customers are provided service during a single service transaction? One or two? A small group? Hundreds?</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">While a service transaction may only involve a guest or two, the restaurant can be full. Does this change the guest's expectation of service? </span> </li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">9. <u>Training</u>: How much training, education, and/or experience is needed to deliver service?</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">Most restaurant jobs (except management) are fairly much entry level. Our guest's perception is most likely that out jobs aren't that hard to learn or perform, whether that is reality or not. They expectation may also be high or low based upon other restaurants they visit.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>        <p align="left">10. <u>Supervision</u>: How much supervision does the service system require?</p>
        <div align="left">
          <ul>
            <li class="style4">In many restaurants, employees appear unsupervised and it is also difficult to tell the manager from the employees. Does this affect our guests' perception about the complexity and supervision required?</li>

        <p>Summary - Understanding Our Guest </p>
        <p align="left">Understanding that everyone is different and the nature of our 24 hour business, we must be prepared to deliver service that will appeal to the broadest spectrum of guests. Our first step in managing quality it to define what a quality experience, in the guest's eyes, would be when they visit Shari's. Above, we have discussed the characteristics of service and the perception of our guests'. Let's see if we can put the two together and make a statement about the quality experience we are to manage.</p>

          <p>The Characteristics of Quality Service at Shari's </p>
          <p align="left"><em>People Orientation and Personal Interaction</em>: It's all about relationships - guests who visit Shari's and employees who work for Shari's have come to expect to be treated as a special and valued individual. Contact with guests is basically physical (in that they can see us) and highly emotional. </p>
          <p align="left"><em>Technology</em>: Shari's is basically low-tech. Managers must focus on the basics, hot food, prepared correctly, friendly and consistent service.</p>
          <p align="left"><em>Time Involvement, Frequency and Location </em>: Most of Shari's guests visit us because of emotional attachment or convenience. Our dining segment is generally know to have a rather short dining time - typically the entire dining experience should be completed within 45 minutes. </p>
          <p align="left"><em>Complexity, Accommodation and Numbers Served</em>: To the guest, the production and service of food seems relatively easy and personalized. Managers must control and direct many operations at once to make this appear so. Guests don't expect their experience to be thrown off simply because the cook is late, they have a <em>small</em> special request or the restaurant is busier than expected. </p>
          <p align="left"><em>Training and Supervision</em>: Here lies the managers greatest tool in providing quality. Managers who train and supervise their employees not only on how to perform the job, but how to do a quality job is successful indeed.</p>
          <p align="left">Fortunately, you do not have to begin from scratch. Shari's have developed many tools to help the manager manage quality. Such items as job descriptions, standards, checklist, and training programs to name a few - which brings us to step two. </p>

        <p class="style7">Step Two - Quality Service Standards </p>
        <p align="left">Step two of managing quality revolve around quality service standards for the entire restaurant. This is the process of taking the characteristics of our service above and molding them into a service image - a portrayal or execution of those characteristics. This is the critical transition in the Customer-Service Management Process, you begin to transform our service characteristics, as seen by our customers, into a well-focused, sharp Service Image, as performed by our employees. </p>

      <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p align="left" class="style14">The Importance of Training and Managing Quality Service Standards</p>
      <p align="left"><span class="style14"><span class="style3">1. Establish A Target: Written service standards establish a goal - a target - </span></span><span class="style14"><span class="style3">toward which all employees can direct their efforts. It gives them a clear sense of what to strive for and how high to reach. It establishes a sense of purpose and direction for them. It keeps them focused, on target, headed in the right direction. </span></span></p>
      <div align="left">
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">As managers, we begin to loose our grip on managing quality when we allow deviation from the standards. For example, when our standards say that breakfast orders be prepared within 4-6 minutes and we continually let our cooks take longer without saying anything - the longer time now becomes the standard. Managing quality begins by getting behind the standards that we have the then modeling them ourselves, training them to our employees and expecting performance.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </div>      
      <p align="left">2. Communicate Expectations: Clear, concise, observable and realistic service standards form a common base of expectations for all service behavior. By establishing them you are communicating to all your employees, &quot;This is what we expect. This is what all of us want. This is what an excellent job is all about.&quot; When you do this you have communicated your expectations loud and clear to everybody involved in customer service. Everybody is on the same wavelength. What you want is common knowledge. There are no surprises about what is expected.</p>
      <div align="left">
        <ul>
            <li class="style4">Fortunately, most service standards for Shari's are in writing - they are already established. Your job is to communicate and supervise them. Standards are communicated in many ways - culture of the company, training provided, literature, example, employee review systems, using the bulletin board and various other ways. In the past we have found that Shari's employees tend to care about what their managers care about - what message are you sending?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>      
      <p align="left">3. Create a Valuable Management Tool: Once you have developed a complete list of service standards, they can become part of recruiting profiles, job descriptions and hiring decisions. Your standards can also easily carry over into your training efforts, so your service operational standards become part and parcel of the standards toward which all employees are prepared for their jobs. In addition, your clear, concise, observable and realistic standards can become the foundation of a meaningful and productive employee performance appraisal system, a system that evaluates the behaviors important to customer service at the level of excellence accepted by everybody in your team. </p>
      <div align="left">
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style4">It really begins with the hiring process. If we, as managers, have a good understanding of what our quality standards are, we can develop questions for the interview  process that draws out those qualities. Once we hire the right person it is our responsibility to provide the best training experience possible. Lastly, there is the review process - always remember - what gets measured, gets done.<br>

The human side of service can be a real challenge - it is emotional, vocal, easily offended and changes from day to day. Most managers are better at dealing with the procedures and would like to avoid the personal. If we are to truly manage the quality of service we must have a good balance.

Quality leaders understand that they cannot expect to get and get and get without giving something back.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="style15">Quality Customer-Service Leaders Use Power Effectively: Quality leaders use power with sensitivity and thoughtfulness, power is never flaunted for its own sake, but used to maintain standard, establish structure, and accomplish goals. When power is used appropriately, it is respected and welcomed by followers. This respect is earned by the manager as employees build trust in the manager's ability to communicate, listen, reward and lead.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="style15">Quality Customer-Service Leaders are Successful Decision Makers: Outstanding quality leaders do not shy away from making decisions. Quality leaders are made by their ability to make the right decisions a the right time - this, in turn builds the respect and trust of employees. This doesn't mean the leader makes only quick and right decisions. Quality leaders know when to ask for input and when to change course if mistakes are made.</span></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="style15">Quality Custom-Service Leaders Create and Maintain a Positive Force: Quality leaders are able to generate a contagious positive force. Leaders of quality set an active tempo that other try to emulate. Quality leaders transmit vigor, vitality as well as a sense of accomplishment and purpose - through good times and bad - for they realize that others are looking to them for guidance and direction. <br>
