    <td colspan="2"><p>Theoretical food cost is calculated by adding up the exact cost of every plate you make and dividing it by sales after discounts are deducted. The theoretical food cost for each store is different because they sell different items. For example: a store that sells more breakfast will have a lower theoretical  food cost (and in turn, should have a lower actual food cost) than a store that sells more dinner items because breakfast food cost is lower. </p>
    <p>In most Shari's there is a 2-5% difference between theoretical and actual food cost. If a store is ringing every meal into the POS system and coding all discounts correctly, the difference between theoretical and actual food cost (the 2-5% mentioned above) represents:</p>

    <td><p>OK, let's be blunt, &quot;Trash Audit&quot; is just a kind name for digging through the trash - and yes, we know that it is no fun. However, occasional random trash audits can be beneficial in identifying areas of waste. Consider too, that your employees can be trained to conduct trash audits - something you can delegate.</p>
    <p>Basically, there are two areas where we do trash audits: out front in the server stations and in the back of the house on the cook and DMO line. <br>

    <td colspan="2"><p>To conduct a trash audit you will need a large tarp. Take the tarp outside to the garbage area and open it up. Place a garbage bag on the tarp and open it up. Spread the garbage out as thinly as possible and begin looking for items. Be sure to wear gloves and use a long handled spatula or tongs to move the garbage around. Also, note where the garbage came from; which side of the cook line or what server station so that you can follow up with those employees. Some stores use different date dots on garbage bags from different locations so that they will always know where the garbage came from. For example, the dishwasher always puts a Monday date dot on the garage bag in server station 1, a Tuesday date dot on the garbage in server station 2 and so on. </p>

To do this you must be familiar with the cost of product and the effect of this loss on profit and food cost. Yelling or posting memos does little good. Your goal is to have your employees understand how they can have a positive affect on profit and work with you. This will take some creativity on your part, but will be worth it in the end. <br>        <br></td>
