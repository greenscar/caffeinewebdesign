    <td colspan="2"><p>The Product Portion and Quality checklist, commonly known as the PPQC, is a tool to help you monitor the portions and quality of food items. When conducting a PPQC there is no gray area, the food item is either to standard or it is not. Of all the developmental tools available, the PPQC is probably the most important as it deals not only with portions (waste and profit), product quality (guest satisfaction and profit), but also, food sanitation (our guest's health, company reputation and profit). </p>
      <p>The PPQC comes in two forms, a short form located on the Back of House Log that is completed twice a day. Today, we will be completing a long form which takes an in depth look at every food item.</p>
    <p>To complete this assignment you will need to print off this form and place it on a clip board. As you go around to inspect each area, read the introduction section, it will explain in detail what you will be looking for. </p></td>

For example: deli sliced ham should be in 2 ounce portions with 8 portions per pack. This is important for consistency of product served and inventory counting. </td>
