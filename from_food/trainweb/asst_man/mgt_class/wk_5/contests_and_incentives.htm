    <td colspan="2">At Shari's we encourage both company sponsored and in-store incentive programs and contests. Our company culture believes that employees should be recognized and rewarded for loyalty and performance. So what is the difference between an incentive and a contest? The purpose of an incentive is to improve an individual's performance from where they are currently. The purpose of a contest is to have the crew compete against each other. For example, the cook's incentive program is designed to improve individual cook knowledge while a server PPE contests is competitive and pits the servers against each other. It is important to understand the difference so that you can determine what format will work best for your particular situation. In this reading assignment we will first determine what makes a contest or incentive effective and then we will discuss different in-store and corporate contests and incentives that we can use to motivate employees and improve performance.</td>

      <p>Ok, hold it a second, why are we talking about training, wasn't that the topic two weeks ago?

Most of us would answer <span class="style2"><em>&quot;To create higher profits, lower turnover, better service and lower costs&quot;. </em><span class="style3">If that is our goal, then the next question we must ask ourselves is <span class="style2">&quot;Why isn't my crew &quot;<em>automatically</em>&quot; serving better, selling more, breaking less, and staying longer?&quot;<span class="style3"> Hummmmm...Maybe a contest or incentive will have no impact. Maybe it's because the staff hasn't first been properly trained to perform or behave according to company standards, policies or procedures. Experience and research shown that a manager's lack of commitment to providing effective, consistent and clear training results in confusion for the employee. And confused people will not act - at least not the way you hope they will. Employees have to know what you expect of them before they can be motivated to exceed your expectations. </span></span></span></span></p></td>

        <p><strong>Corporate Incentive Programs</strong></p>
        <p align="left">The company sponsors several incentive programs. Remember, incentive programs are designed to improve personal performance without competition. It is to a store's benefit to participate fully in these corporate programs as they have the end result of improving store performance and moral and most of the expense is paid by corporate. Let's take a look at a few of the corporate programs.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>Anniversary Program</u>: Shari's anniversary program recognizes employees for their years of service. Each year employees receive pins and on key years they receive a gift (jackets, backpacks, rings and watches). One thing that a manager can do to make this program more affective in their store is to make it public. You will receive your awards each month, rather than just handing them out to the employee, make a public display of the presentation.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>100 Club</u>: Shari's 100 club recognizes employees who learn 100 guest's names and something about them. The employee receives a $25 cash bonus, a pin and certificate. 100 club names are called into the corporate receptionist and the bonus is paid from the store using a cash paid out slip.  At times, managers minimize this program because they don't want to pay the bonus. However, the bonus is more than paid back by increased customer loyalty and frequency - every manager should be behind this program.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>100%er Beverage Club</u>: The beverage club rewards employee whose beverage count matches or exceeds their guest count. When a server attains 100% beverage sales for a week, they receive a copper coffee mug. If they maintain this pace for four weeks, they receive a pin (first time) and a $25 bonus. Again, a server who sells a beverage to every guest more that pays for the bonus.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>Hospitality Hero</u>: The hospitality hero program recognizes employees who receive a personal compliment from a guest either in writing, phone call or email. When guests leave a written comment about an employee, fax it to the corporate office. Mentioned employees receive a special pin and a personal letter from Larry. You will receive these monthly and you should make a production and honor your employee publicly.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>Cook Incentive Program</u>: Shari's cook incentive program is a testing process that rewards cooks for their knowledge of cooking standards and procedures. Three times a year tests are sent to the stores and managers are responsible for issuing them to their cooks, collecting them and sending them to corporate for grading. All cooks who pass with 90% receive a gift. It is really to a manager's benefit to have their cooks participate in the program - really, who wouldn't want a cook to know the standards? Again, you should make a big deal of awarding prizes when they arrive.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>Store Incentive Programs</u>: Stores are able to implement their own incentive programs with their District Manager's approval. Incentive contests (where employees try to improve their performance and not compete against each other) work well for increasing PPE (this eliminates the shift variance) reducing costs, or improving quality and service. The key is to be creative and answer the six questions at the end of this reading assignment. </p>

        <p><strong>Conducting Contests</strong></p>
        <p align="left"><u>Corporate Contests</u>: Some contests are sponsored by the corporate office. These are mandatory contests, are paid for by corporate and include a lot of support material. Corporate contest are typically short in duration. You can run shift contest to enhance the corporate contest but you shouldn't run any other type of contest that would compete with the focus of the corporate contest. The key to making corporate contests successful is to communicate the goals to your employees. You are usually provided with posters, charts, meeting agendas and ideas for implementing and sustaining the contest. However, no contest runs itself, the success of a contest is in direct relationship to the efforts of the management staff.</p>
        <p align="left"><u>Store Contests</u>: Shari's give the managers a lot of autonomy to run contests in their store. Shari's Green Marketing Binder includes a chapter with lots of ideas for contest or you are free to adapt these or make up your own. Before you begin any incentive or contest be sure to ask yourself the following six questions.<br>
